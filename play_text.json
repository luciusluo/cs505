distinction yet stand off in differences so mighty if she be all that is virtuous save what thou dislikest a poor physician 's daughter thou dislikest of virtue for the name but do not so from lowest place when virtuous things proceed the place is dignified by the doer 's deed where great additions swell 's and virtue none it is a dropsied honour good alone is good without a name vileness is so the property by what it is should go not by the title she is young wise fair in these to nature she 's immediate heir and these breed honour that is honour 's scorn which challenges itself as honour 's born and is not like the sire honours thrive when rather from our acts we them derive than our foregoers the mere word 's a slave debosh'd on every tomb on every grave a lying trophy and as oft is dumb where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb of honour'd bones indeed what should be said if thou canst like this creature as a maid i can create the rest virtue and she is her own dower honour and

believe not thy disdain but presently do thine own fortunes that obedient right which both thy duty owes and our power claims or i will throw thee from my care for ever into the staggers and the careless lapse of youth and ignorance both my revenge and hate loosing upon thee in the name of justice without all terms of pity speak thine answer pardon my gracious lord for i submit my fancy to your eyes when i consider what great creation and what dole of honour flies where you bid it i find that she which late was in my nobler thoughts most base is now the praised of the king who so ennobled is as twere born so take her by the hand and tell her she is thine to whom i promise a counterpoise if not to thy estate a balance more replete i take her hand good fortune and the favour of

the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship 's entertainment it were fit you knew him lest reposing too far in his virtue which he hath not he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you i would i knew in what particular action to try him none better than to let him fetch off his drum which you hear him so confidently undertake to do i with a troop of florentines will suddenly surprise him such i will have whom i am sure he knows not from the enemy we will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when we bring him to our own tents be but your lordship present at his examination if he do not for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath never trust my judgment in any thing o for the love of laughter let him fetch his drum he says he has a stratagem for't when your lordship sees the bottom of his success in't and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted if you give him not john drum 's entertainment your inclining can not be removed here he comes enter parolles aside to bertram   o for the love of laughter hinder not the honour of his design let him fetch off his drum in any hand how now monsieur this drum sticks sorely in your disposition a pox on't let it go tis but a drum but a drum is't but a drum a drum so lost there was excellent command,--to charge in with our horse upon our own wings and to rend our own soldiers that was not to be blamed in the command of the service it was a disaster of war that caesar himself could not have prevented if he had been there to command well we can not greatly condemn our success some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum but it is not to be recovered it might have been recovered it might but it is not now it is to be recovered but that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer i would have that drum or another or hic jacet why if you have a stomach to't monsieur if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native quarter be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on i will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit if you speed well in it the duke shall both speak of it and extend to you what further becomes his greatness even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness by the hand of a soldier i will undertake it but you must not now slumber in it i 'll about it this evening and i will presently pen down my dilemmas encourage myself in my certainty put myself into my mortal preparation and by midnight look to hear further from me may i be bold to acquaint his

dares better be damned than to do't you do not know him my lord as we do certain it is that he will steal himself into a man 's favour and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries but when you find him out you have him ever after why do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto none in the world but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies but we have almost embossed him you shall see his fall to night for indeed he is not for your lordship 's respect we 'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him

especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king who had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him i will tell you a thing but you shall let it dwell darkly with you when you have spoken it tis dead and i am the grave of it he hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in florence of a most chaste renown and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour he hath given her his monumental ring and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition now god delay our rebellion as we are ourselves what things are we merely our own traitors and as in the common course of all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorred ends so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility in his proper stream o'erflows himself is it

i hope to live shall i set down your answer so do i 'll take the sacrament on't how and which way you will all 's one to him what a past saving slave is this you 're deceived my lord this is monsieur parolles the gallant militarist,--that was his own phrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf and the practise in the chape of his dagger i will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean nor believe he can have every thing in him by wearing his apparel neatly well that 's set down five or six thousand horse i said,-- i will say true,--or thereabouts set down for i 'll speak truth he 's very near the truth in this but i con him no thanks for't in the nature he delivers it poor rogues i pray you say well that 's set down i humbly thank you sir a truth 's a

camp a frenchman what his reputation is with the duke what his valour honesty and expertness in wars or whether he thinks it were not possible with well weighing sums of gold to corrupt him to revolt what say you to this what do you know of it i beseech you let me answer to the particular of the inter'gatories demand them singly do you know this captain dumain i know him a was a botcher 's

reputation with the duke the duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine and writ to me this other day to turn him out o the band i think i have his letter in my pocket marry we 'll search in good sadness i do not know either it is there or it is upon a file with the duke 's other letters in my tent here tis here 's a paper shall i read it to you i do not know if it be it or no our interpreter does it well excellently reads   dian the count 's a fool and full of gold,'-- that is not the duke 's letter sir that is an advertisement to a proper maid in florence one diana to take heed of the allurement of one count rousillon a foolish idle boy but for all that very ruttish i pray you sir put it up again nay i 'll read it first by your favour my meaning in't i protest was very honest in the behalf of the maid for i knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy who is a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it finds damnable both sides rogue reads   when he swears oaths bid him drop gold and take it after he scores he never pays the score half won is match well made match and well make it he ne'er pays after debts take it before and say a soldier dian told thee this men are to mell with boys are not to kiss for count of this the count 's a fool i know it who pays before but not when he does owe it thine as he vowed to thee in thine ear parolles he shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme in 's forehead this is your devoted friend sir the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier i could endure any thing before but a cat and now he 's a cat to me i perceive sir by the general 's looks we shall be fain to hang you my life sir in any case not that i am afraid to die but that my offences being many i would repent out the remainder of nature let me live sir in a dungeon i the stocks or any where so i may live we 'll see what may be done so you confess freely therefore once more to this captain dumain you have answered to his reputation with the duke and to his valour what is his honesty he will steal sir an egg out of a cloister for rapes and ravishments he parallels nessus he professes not keeping of oaths in breaking 'em he is stronger than hercules he will lie sir with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool drunkenness is his best virtue for he will be swine drunk and in his sleep he does little harm save to his bed clothes about him but they know his conditions and lay him in straw i have but little more to say sir of his honesty he has every thing that an honest man should not have what an honest man should have he has nothing i begin to love him for this for this description of thine honesty a pox upon him for me he 's more and more a cat what say you to his expertness in war faith sir he has led the drum before the english tragedians to belie him i will not and more of his soldiership i know not except in that country he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called mile end to instruct for the doubling of files i would do the man what honour i can but of this i am not certain he hath out villained villany so far that the rarity redeems him a pox on him he 's a cat still his qualities being at this poor price i need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt sir for a quart d'ecu he will sell the fee simple of his salvation the inheritance of it and cut the entail from all remainders and a perpetual succession for it perpetually what 's his brother the other captain dumain why does be ask him of me what 's he e'en a crow o the same nest not altogether so great as the first in goodness but greater a great deal in evil he excels his brother for a coward yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is in a retreat he outruns any lackey marry in coming on he has the cramp if your life be saved will you undertake to betray the florentine ay and the captain of his horse count rousillon i 'll whisper with the general and know his pleasure aside   i 'll no more drumming a plague of all drums only to seem to deserve well and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the count have i run into this danger yet who would have suspected an ambush where i was taken there is no remedy sir but you must die the general says you that have so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held can serve the world for no honest use therefore you must die come headsman off with his head o lord sir let me live or let me see my death that shall you and take your

he promised me marriage faith i know more than i 'll speak but wilt thou not speak all thou knowest yes so please your majesty i did go between them as i said but more than that he loved her for indeed he was mad for her and talked of satan and of limbo and of furies and i know not what yet i was in that credit with them at that time that i knew of their going to bed and of other motions as promising her marriage and things which would derive me ill will to speak of therefore i will not speak what i know thou hast spoken all already unless thou canst say they are married but thou art too

philosophy i can but say their protestation over so much dear liege i have already sworn that is to live and study here three years but there are other strict observances as not to see a woman in that term which i hope well is not enrolled there and one day in a week to touch no food and but one meal on every day beside the which i hope is not enrolled there and then to sleep but three hours in the night and not be seen to wink of all the day-- when i was wo nt to think no harm all night and make a dark night too of half the day-- which i hope well is not enrolled there o these are barren tasks

the cause why we were born therefore of all hands must we be forsworn what did these rent lines show some love of thine did they quoth you who sees the heavenly rosaline that like a rude and savage man of inde at the first opening of the gorgeous east bows not his vassal head and strucken blind kisses the base ground with obedient breast what peremptory eagle sighted eye dares look upon the heaven of her brow that is not blinded by her majesty what zeal what fury hath inspired thee now my love her mistress is a gracious moon she an attending star scarce seen a light my eyes are then no eyes nor i biron o but for my love day would turn to night of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek where several worthies make one dignity where nothing wants that want itself doth seek lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,-- fie painted rhetoric o she needs it not to things of sale a seller 's praise belongs she passes praise then praise too short doth blot a wither'd hermit five score winters worn might shake off fifty looking in her eye beauty doth varnish age as if new born and gives the crutch the cradle 's infancy o tis the sun that maketh all things shine by heaven thy love is black as ebony is ebony like her o wood divine a wife of such wood were felicity o who can give an oath where is a book that i may swear beauty doth beauty lack if that she learn not of her eye to look no face is fair that is not full so black o paradox black is the badge of hell the hue of dungeons and the suit of night and beauty 's crest becomes the heavens well devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light o if in black my lady 's brows be deck'd it mourns that painting and usurping hair should ravish doters with a false aspect and therefore is she born to make black fair her favour turns the fashion of the days for native blood is counted painting now and therefore red that would avoid dispraise paints itself black to imitate her brow to look like her are chimney sweepers black and since her time are colliers counted bright and ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack dark needs no candles now for dark is light your mistresses dare never come in rain for fear their colours should be wash'd away twere good yours did for sir to tell you plain i 'll find a fairer face not wash'd to day i 'll prove her fair or talk till doomsday here no devil will fright thee then so much as she i never knew man hold vile stuff so dear look here 's thy love my foot and her face see o if the streets were paved with thine eyes her feet were much too dainty for such tread o vile then as she goes what upward lies the street should see as she walk'd overhead but what of this are we not all in love nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn then leave this chat and good biron now prove our loving lawful and our faith not torn ay marry there some flattery for this evil o some authority how to proceed some tricks some quillets how to cheat the devil some salve for perjury tis more than need have at you then affection 's men at arms consider what you first did swear unto to fast to study and to see no woman flat treason gainst the kingly state of youth say can you fast your stomachs are too young and abstinence engenders maladies and where that you have vow'd to study lords in that each of you have forsworn his book can you still dream and pore and thereon look for when would you my lord or you or you have found the ground of study 's excellence without the beauty of a woman 's face from women 's eyes this doctrine i derive   they are the ground the books the academes from whence doth spring the true promethean fire why universal plodding poisons up the nimble spirits in the arteries as motion and long during action tires the sinewy vigour of the traveller now for not looking on a woman 's face you have in that forsworn the use of eyes and study too the causer of your vow for where is any author in the world teaches such beauty as a woman 's eye learning is but an adjunct to ourself and where we are our learning likewise is then when ourselves we see in ladies eyes do we not likewise see our learning there o we have made a vow to study lords and in that vow we have forsworn our books for when would you my liege or you or you in leaden contemplation have found out such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes of beauty 's tutors have enrich'd you with other slow arts entirely keep the brain and therefore finding barren practisers scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil but love first learned in a lady 's eyes lives not alone immured in the brain but with the motion of all elements courses as swift as thought in every power and gives to every power a double power above their functions and their offices it adds a precious seeing to the eye a lover 's eyes will gaze an eagle blind a lover 's ear will hear the lowest sound when the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd love 's feeling is more soft and sensible than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails love 's tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste for valour is not love a hercules still climbing trees in the hesperides subtle as sphinx as sweet and musical as bright apollo 's lute strung with his hair and when love speaks the voice of all the gods makes heaven drowsy with the harmony never durst poet touch a pen to write until his ink were temper'd with love 's sighs o then his lines would ravish savage ears and plant in tyrants mild humility from women 's eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still the right promethean fire they are the books the arts the academes that show contain and nourish all the world else none at all in ought proves excellent then fools you were these women to forswear or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools for wisdom 's sake a word that all men love or for love 's sake a word that loves all men or for men 's sake the authors of these women or women 's sake by whom we men are men let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths it is religion to be thus forsworn for charity itself fulfills the law and who can sever love from charity saint cupid

comes boyet and mirth is in his face enter boyet o i am stabb'd with laughter where 's her grace thy news boyet prepare madam prepare arm wenches arm encounters mounted are against your peace love doth approach disguised armed in arguments you 'll be surprised muster your wits stand in your own defence or hide your heads like cowards and fly hence saint denis to saint cupid what are they that charge their breath against us say scout say under the cool shade of a sycamore i thought to close mine eyes some half an hour when lo to interrupt my purposed rest toward that shade i might behold addrest the king and his companions warily i stole into a neighbour thicket by and overheard what you shall overhear that by and by disguised they will be here their herald is a pretty knavish page that well by heart hath conn'd his embassage action and accent did they teach him there thus must thou speak and thus thy body bear and ever and anon they made a doubt presence majestical would put him out for quoth the king an angel shalt thou see yet fear not thou but speak audaciously the boy replied an angel is not evil i should have fear'd her had she been a devil with that all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder making the bold wag by their praises bolder one rubb'd his elbow thus and fleer'd and swore a better speech was never spoke before another with his finger and his thumb cried via we will do't come what will come the third he caper'd and cried all goes well the fourth turn'd on the toe and down he fell with that they all did tumble on the ground with such a zealous laughter so profound that in this spleen ridiculous appears to cheque their folly passion 's solemn tears but what but what come they to visit us they do they do and are apparell'd thus like muscovites or russians as i guess their purpose is to parle to court and dance and every one his love feat will advance unto his several mistress which they 'll know by favours several which they did bestow and will they so the gallants shall be task'd for ladies we shall every one be mask'd and not a man of them shall have the grace despite of suit to see a lady 's face hold rosaline this favour thou shalt wear and then the king will court thee for his dear hold take thou this my sweet and give me thine so shall biron take me for rosaline and change your favours too so shall your loves woo contrary deceived by these removes come on then wear the favours most in sight but in this changing what is your intent the effect of my intent is to cross theirs they do it but in mocking merriment and mock for mock is only my intent their several counsels they unbosom shall to loves mistook and so be mock'd withal upon the next occasion that we meet with visages displayed to talk and greet but shall we dance if they desire to't no to the death we will not move a foot nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace but while tis spoke each turn away her face why that contempt will kill the speaker 's heart and quite divorce his memory from his part therefore i do it and i make no doubt the rest will ne'er come in if he be out there 's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown to make theirs ours and ours none but our own so shall we stay mocking intended game and they well mock'd depart away with shame trumpets sound within the trumpet sounds be mask'd the maskers come the ladies mask enter blackamoors with music moth ferdinand   biron longaville and dumain in russian habits and masked all hail the richest beauties on the earth!-- beauties no richer than rich taffeta a holy

miles to tread a measure with her on this grass they say that they have measured many a mile to tread a measure with you on this grass it is not so ask them how many inches is in one mile if they have measured many the measure then of one is easily told if to come hither you have measured miles and many miles the princess bids you tell how many inches doth fill up one mile tell her we measure them by weary steps she hears herself how many weary steps of many weary miles you have o'ergone are number'd in the travel of one mile we number nothing that we spend for you our duty is so rich so infinite that we may do it still without accompt vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face that we like savages may worship it my face is but a moon and clouded too blessed are clouds to do as such

for all your fair endeavors and entreat out of a new sad soul that you vouchsafe in your rich wisdom to excuse or hide the liberal opposition of our spirits if over boldly we have borne ourselves in the converse of breath your gentleness was guilty of it farewell worthy lord a heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue excuse me so coming too short of thanks for my great suit so easily obtain'd the extreme parts of time extremely forms all causes to the purpose of his speed and often at his very loose decides that which long process could not arbitrate and though the mourning brow of progeny forbid the smiling courtesy of love the holy suit which fain it would convince yet since love 's argument was first on foot let not the cloud of sorrow justle it from what it purposed since to wail friends lost is not by much so wholesome profitable as to rejoice at friends but newly found i understand you not my griefs are double honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief and by these badges understand the king for your fair sakes have we neglected time play'd foul play with our oaths your beauty ladies hath much deform'd us fashioning our humours even to the opposed end of our intents and what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,-- as love is full of unbefitting strains all wanton as a child skipping and vain form'd by the eye and therefore like the eye full of strange shapes of habits and of forms varying in subjects as the eye doth roll to every varied object in his glance which parti coated presence of loose love put on by us if in your heavenly eyes have misbecomed our oaths and gravities those heavenly eyes that look into these faults suggested us to make therefore ladies our love being yours the error that love makes is likewise yours we to ourselves prove false by being once false for ever to be true to those that make us both,--fair ladies you and even that falsehood in itself a sin thus purifies itself and turns to grace we have received your letters full of love your favours the ambassadors of love and in our maiden council rated them at courtship pleasant jest and courtesy as bombast and as lining to the time but more devout than this in our respects have we not been and therefore met your loves in their own fashion like a merriment our letters madam show'd much more than jest so did our looks we did not quote them so now at the latest minute of the hour grant us your loves a time methinks too short to make a world without end bargain in no no my lord your grace is perjured much full of dear guiltiness and therefore this if for my love as there is no such cause you will do aught this shall you do for me your oath i will not trust but go with speed to some forlorn and naked hermitage remote from all the pleasures of the world there stay until the twelve celestial signs have brought about the annual reckoning if this austere insociable life change not your offer made in heat of blood if frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weeds nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love but that it bear this trial and last love then at the expiration of the year come challenge me challenge me by these deserts and by this virgin palm now kissing thine i will be thine and till that instant shut my woeful self up in a mourning house raining the tears of lamentation for the remembrance of my father 's death if this thou do deny let our hands part neither entitled in the other 's heart if this or more than this i would deny to flatter up these powers of mine with rest the sudden hand of death close up mine eye hence ever then my heart is in thy breast but what to me my love but what to me a wife a beard fair health and honesty with three fold love i wish you all these three o shall i say i thank you gentle wife not so my lord a twelvemonth and a day i 'll mark no words that smooth faced wooers say come when the king doth to my lady come then if i have much love i 'll give you some i 'll serve thee true and faithfully till then yet swear not lest ye be forsworn again what says maria at the twelvemonth 's end i 'll change my black gown for a faithful friend i 'll stay with patience but the time is long the liker you few taller are so young studies my lady mistress look on me behold the window of my heart mine eye what humble suit attends thy answer there impose some service on me for thy love oft have i heard of you my lord biron before i saw you and the world 's large tongue proclaims you for a man replete with mocks full of comparisons and wounding flouts which you on all estates will execute that lie within the mercy of your wit to weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain and therewithal to win me if you please without the which i am not to be won you shall this twelvemonth term from day to day visit the speechless sick and still converse with groaning wretches and your task shall be with all the fierce endeavor of your wit to enforce the pained impotent to smile to move wild laughter in the throat of death it can not be it is impossible mirth can not move a soul in agony why that 's the way to choke a gibing spirit whose influence is begot of that loose grace which shallow laughing hearers give to fools a jest 's prosperity lies in the ear of him that hears it never in the tongue of him that makes it then if sickly ears deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans will hear your idle scorns continue then and i will have you and that fault withal but if they will not throw away that spirit and i shall find you empty of that fault right joyful of your reformation a twelvemonth well befall what will befall i 'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital to ferdinand   ay sweet my lord and so i take my leave no madam we will bring you on your way our wooing doth not end

rich and very rich but thou'rt too much my friend and i 'll not wish thee to her signior hortensio twixt such friends as we few words suffice and therefore if thou know one rich enough to be petruchio

is why give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet baby or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head though she have as many diseases as two and fifty horses why nothing comes amiss so money comes withal petruchio since we are stepp'd thus far in i will continue that i broach'd in jest i can petruchio help thee to a wife with wealth enough and young and beauteous brought up as best

more eyes to see withal than a cat you know him not sir tarry petruchio i must go with thee for in baptista 's keep my treasure is he hath the jewel of my life in hold his youngest daughter beautiful binaca and her withholds from me and other more suitors to her and rivals in my love supposing it a thing impossible for those defects i have before rehearsed that ever katharina will be woo'd

stirrups of no kindred besides possessed with the glanders and like to mose in the chine troubled with the lampass infected with the fashions full of wingdalls sped with spavins rayed with yellows past cure of the fives stark spoiled with the staggers begnawn with the bots swayed in the back and shoulder shotten near legged before and with a half chequed bit and a head stall of sheeps leather which being restrained to keep him from stumbling hath been often burst and now repaired with knots one girth six time pieced and a woman 's crupper of velure which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs and here and there pieced with packthread who comes with him o sir his lackey for all the world caparisoned like the horse with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot hose on the other gartered with a red and blue list an old hat and the humour of forty fancies pricked in't for a feather a monster a very monster in apparel and not like a christian footboy or a gentleman 's lackey tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion yet oftentimes he goes but mean apparell'd i am glad he 's come howsoe'er he comes why sir he comes not didst thou not say he comes who that

bridegroom took him such a cuff that down fell priest and book and book and priest now take them up quoth he if any list what said the wench when he rose again trembled and shook for why he stamp'd and swore as if the vicar meant to cozen him but after many ceremonies done he calls for wine a health quoth he as if he had been aboard carousing to his mates after a storm quaff'd off the muscadel and threw the sops all in the sexton 's face having no other reason but that his beard grew thin and hungerly and seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking this done he took the bride about the neck

thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee and for thy maintenance commits his body to painful labour both by sea and land to watch the night in storms the day in cold whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe and craves no other tribute at thy hands but love fair looks and true obedience too little payment for so great a debt such duty as the subject owes the prince even such a woman oweth to her husband and when she is froward peevish sullen sour and not obedient to his honest will what is she but a foul contending rebel and graceless traitor to her loving lord i am ashamed that women are so simple to offer war where they should kneel for peace or seek for rule supremacy and sway when they are bound to serve love and obey why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth unapt to toil and trouble in the world but that our soft conditions and our hearts should well agree with our external parts come come you froward and unable worms

break themselves in swearing most sweet queen,-- nay pray you seek no colour for your going but bid farewell and go when you sued staying then was the time for words no going then eternity was in our

water now i see i see in fulvia 's death how mine received shall be quarrel no more but be prepared to know the purposes i bear which are or cease as you shall give the advice by the fire that quickens nilus slime i go from hence thy soldier servant making peace or war as thou affect'st cut my lace charmian come but let it be i am quickly ill and well so antony loves my precious queen forbear and give true evidence to his love which stands an honourable trial so fulvia told me i prithee turn aside and weep for her then bid adieu to me and say the tears belong to egypt good now play one scene of excellent dissembling and let it look life perfect honour you 'll heat my blood no more you can do better yet but this is meetly now by my sword,-- and target still he mends but this is not the best look prithee charmian how this herculean roman does become the carriage of his chafe i 'll leave you lady courteous lord one word sir you and i must part but that 's not it sir you and i have loved but there 's not it that you know well something it is i would o my oblivion is a very antony and i am all forgotten but that your royalty holds idleness your subject i should take you for idleness itself tis sweating labour to bear such idleness so near the heart as cleopatra this but sir forgive me since my becomings kill me when they do not eye well to you your honour calls you hence

you may see lepidus and henceforth know it is not caesar 's natural vice to hate our great competitor from alexandria this is the news he fishes drinks and wastes the lamps of night in revel is not more man like than cleopatra nor the queen of ptolemy more womanly than he hardly gave audience or vouchsafed to think he had partners you shall find there a man who is the abstract of all faults that all men follow i must not think there are evils enow to darken all his goodness his faults in him seem as the spots of heaven more fiery by night 's blackness hereditary rather than purchased what he can not change than what he chooses you are too indulgent let us grant it is not amiss to tumble on the bed of ptolemy to give a kingdom for a mirth to sit and keep the turn of tippling with a slave to reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet with knaves that smell of sweat say this becomes him,-- as his composure must be rare indeed whom these things can not blemish,--yet must antony no way excuse his soils when we do bear so great weight in his lightness if he fill'd his vacancy with his voluptuousness full surfeits and the dryness of his bones call on him for't but to confound such time that drums him from his sport and speaks as loud as his own state and ours,--'tis to be chid as we rate boys who being mature in knowledge pawn their experience to their present pleasure and so rebel to judgment enter a messenger here 's more news thy biddings have been done and every hour most noble caesar shalt thou have report how tis abroad pompey is strong at sea and it appears he is beloved of those that only have fear'd caesar to the ports the discontents repair and men 's reports give him much wrong'd i should have known no less it hath been taught us from the primal state that he which is was wish'd until he were and the ebb'd man ne'er loved till ne'er worth love comes dear'd by being lack'd this common body like to a vagabond flag upon the stream goes to and back lackeying the varying tide to rot itself with motion caesar i bring thee word menecrates and menas famous pirates make the sea serve them which they ear and wound with keels of every kind many hot inroads they make in italy the borders maritime lack blood to think on't and flush youth revolt no vessel can peep forth but tis as soon taken as seen for pompey 's name strikes more than could his war resisted antony leave thy lascivious wassails when thou once wast beaten from modena where thou slew'st hirtius and pansa consuls at thy heel did famine follow whom thou fought'st against though daintily brought up with patience more than savages could suffer thou didst drink the stale of horses and the gilded puddle which beasts would cough at thy palate then did deign the roughest berry on the rudest hedge yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets the barks of trees thou browsed'st on the alps it is reported thou didst eat strange flesh which some did die to look on and all this-- it wounds thine honour that i speak it now-- was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek so much as lank'd not tis pity of him let his shames quickly drive him to rome tis time we twain did show ourselves i the field and to that end assemble we immediate council pompey thrives in our idleness to morrow caesar i shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly both what by sea and land i can be able

what indeed is honest to be done yet have i fierce affections and think what venus did with mars o charmian where think'st thou he is now stands he or sits he or does he walk or is he on his horse o happy horse to bear the weight of antony do bravely horse for wot'st thou whom thou movest the demi atlas of this earth the arm and burgonet of men he 's speaking now or murmuring where 's my serpent of old nile for so he calls me now i feed myself with most delicious poison think on me that am with phoebus amorous pinches black and wrinkled deep in time broad fronted caesar when thou wast here above the ground i was a morsel for a monarch and great pompey would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow there would he anchor his aspect and die with looking on his life enter alexas from octavius caesar sovereign of egypt hail how much unlike art thou mark antony yet coming from him that great medicine hath with his tinct gilded thee how goes it with my brave mark antony last thing he did dear queen he kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,-- this orient pearl his speech sticks in my heart mine ear must pluck it thence good friend quoth he say the firm roman to great egypt sends this treasure of an oyster at whose foot to mend the petty present i will piece her opulent throne with kingdoms all the east say thou shall call her mistress so he nodded and soberly did mount an arm gaunt steed who neigh'd so high that what i would have spoke was beastly dumb'd by him what was he sad or merry like to the time o the year between the extremes of hot and cold he was nor sad nor merry o well divided disposition note him note him good charmian tis the man but note him he was not sad for he would shine on those that make their looks by his he was not merry which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay in egypt with his joy but between both o heavenly mingle be'st thou sad or merry the violence of either thee becomes so does it no man else met'st thou my posts ay madam twenty several messengers why do you send so thick who 's born that day when i forget to send to antony shall die a beggar ink and paper charmian welcome my good alexas did i charmian ever love caesar so o that brave caesar be choked with such another emphasis say the brave antony the valiant caesar by isis i will give thee bloody teeth if thou with caesar paragon again my man of men by your most

pompey that what they do delay they not deny whiles we are suitors to their throne decays the thing we sue for we ignorant of ourselves beg often our own harms which the wise powers deny us for our good so find we profit by losing of our prayers i shall do well the people love me and the sea is mine my powers are crescent and my auguring hope says it will come to the full mark antony in egypt sits at dinner and will make no wars without doors caesar gets money where he loses hearts lepidus flatters both of both is flatter'd but he neither loves nor either cares for him caesar and lepidus are in the field a mighty strength they carry where have you this tis false from silvius sir he dreams i know they are in rome together looking for antony but all the charms of love salt cleopatra soften thy waned lip let witchcraft join with beauty lust with both tie up the libertine in a field of feasts keep his brain fuming epicurean cooks sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite that sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour even till a lethe'd dulness enter varrius how now varrius this is most certain that i shall deliver mark antony is every hour in rome expected since he went from egypt tis a space for further travel i could have given less matter a better ear menas i did not think this amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm for such a petty war his soldiership is twice the other twain but let us rear the higher our opinion that our stirring can from the lap of egypt 's widow pluck the ne'er lust wearied antony i can not hope caesar and antony shall well greet together his wife that 's dead did trespasses to caesar his brother warr'd upon him although i think not moved by antony i know not menas how lesser enmities may give way to greater were't not that we stand up against them all twere pregnant they should square between themselves for they have entertained cause enough to draw their swords but how the fear of us may cement their divisions and bind up the petty difference we yet not know be't as our gods will have't it only stands our lives upon to use our strongest hands come menas exeunt scene ii rome the house of lepidus enter domitius enobarbus and lepidus good enobarbus tis a worthy deed and shall become you well to entreat your captain to soft and gentle speech i shall entreat him to answer like himself if caesar move him let antony look over caesar 's head and speak as loud as mars by jupiter were i the wearer of antonius beard i would not shave't to day tis not a time for private stomaching every time serves for the matter that is then born in't but small to greater matters must give way not if the small come first your speech is passion but pray you stir no embers up here comes the noble antony enter mark antony and ventidius and yonder caesar enter octavius caesar mecaenas and agrippa if we compose well here to parthia hark ventidius i do not know mecaenas ask agrippa noble friends that which combined us was most great and let not a leaner action rend us what 's amiss may it be gently heard when we debate our trivial difference loud we do commit murder in healing wounds then noble partners the rather for i earnestly beseech touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms nor curstness grow to the matter tis spoken well were we before our armies and to fight i should do thus flourish welcome to rome thank you sit sit sir nay then i learn you take things ill which are not so or being concern you not i must be laugh'd at if or for nothing or a little i should say myself offended and with you chiefly i the world more laugh'd at that i should once name you derogately when to sound your name it not concern'd me my being in egypt caesar what was't to you no more than my residing here at rome might be to you in egypt yet if you there did practise on my state your being in egypt might be my question how intend you practised you may be pleased to catch at mine intent by what did here befal me your wife and brother made wars upon me and their contestation was theme for you you were the word of war you do mistake your business my brother never did urge me in his act i did inquire it and have my learning from some true reports that drew their swords with you did he not rather discredit my authority with yours and make the wars alike against my stomach having alike your cause of this my letters before did satisfy you if you 'll patch a quarrel as matter whole you have not to make it with it must not be with this you praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me but you patch'd up your excuses not so not so i know you could not lack i am certain on't very necessity of this thought that i your partner in the cause gainst which he fought could not with graceful eyes attend those wars which fronted mine own peace as for my wife i would you had her spirit in such another the third o the world is yours which with a snaffle you may pace easy but not such a wife would we had all such wives that the men might go to wars with the women so much uncurbable her garboils caesar made out of her impatience which not wanted shrewdness of policy too i grieving grant did you too much disquiet for that you must but say i could not help it i wrote to you when rioting in alexandria you did pocket up my letters and with taunts did gibe my missive out of audience sir he fell upon me ere admitted then three kings i had newly feasted and did want of what i was i the morning but next day i told him of myself which was as much as to have ask'd him pardon let this fellow be nothing of our strife if we contend out of our question wipe him you have broken the article of your oath which you shall never have tongue to charge me with soft caesar no lepidus let him speak the honour is sacred which he talks on now supposing that i lack'd it but on caesar the article of my oath to lend me arms and aid when i required them the which you both denied neglected rather and then when poison'd hours had bound me up from mine own knowledge as nearly as i may i 'll play the penitent to you but mine honesty shall not make poor my greatness nor my power work without it truth is that fulvia to have me out of egypt made wars here for which myself the ignorant motive do so far ask pardon as befits mine honour to stoop in such a case tis noble spoken if it might please you to enforce no further the griefs between ye to forget them quite were to remember that the present need speaks to atone you worthily spoken mecaenas or if you borrow one another 's love for the instant you may when you hear no more words of pompey return it again you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do thou art a soldier only speak no more that truth should be silent i had almost forgot you wrong this presence therefore speak no more go to then your considerate stone i do not much dislike the matter but the manner of his speech for't can not be we shall remain in friendship our conditions so differing in their acts yet if i knew what hoop should hold us stanch from edge to edge o the world i would pursue it give me leave caesar,-- speak agrippa thou hast a sister by the mother 's side admired octavia great mark antony is now a widower say not so agrippa if cleopatra heard you your reproof were well deserved of rashness i am not married caesar let me hear agrippa further speak to hold you in perpetual amity to make you brothers and to knit your hearts with an unslipping   knot take antony octavia to his wife whose beauty claims no worse a husband than the best of men whose virtue and whose general graces speak that which none else can utter by this marriage all little jealousies which now seem great and all great fears which now import their dangers would then be nothing truths would be tales where now half tales be truths her love to both would each to other and all loves to both draw after her pardon what i have spoke for tis a studied not a present thought by duty ruminated will caesar speak not till he hears how antony is touch'd with what is spoke already what power is in agrippa if i would say agrippa be it so to make this good the power of caesar and his power unto octavia may i never to this good purpose that so fairly shows dream of impediment let me have thy hand further this act of grace and from this hour the heart of brothers govern in our loves and sway our great designs there is my hand a sister i bequeath you whom no brother did ever love so dearly let her live to join our kingdoms and our hearts and never fly off our loves again happily amen i did not think to draw my sword gainst pompey for he hath laid strange courtesies and great of late upon me i must thank him only lest my remembrance suffer ill report at heel of that defy him time calls upon 's of us must pompey presently be sought or else he seeks out us where lies he about the mount misenum what is his strength by land great and increasing but by sea he is an absolute master so is the fame would we had spoke together haste we for it yet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch we the business we have talk'd of with most gladness and do invite you to my sister 's view whither straight i 'll lead you let us lepidus not lack your company noble antony not sickness should detain me flourish exeunt octavius caesar mark antony and lepidus welcome from egypt sir

monstrous matter of feast which worthily deserved noting she 's a most triumphant lady if report be square to her when she first met mark antony she pursed up his heart upon the river of cydnus there she appeared indeed or my reporter devised well for her i will tell you the barge she sat in like a burnish'd throne burn'd on the water the poop was beaten gold purple the sails and so perfumed that the winds were love sick with them the oars were silver which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made the water which they beat to follow faster as amorous of their strokes for her own person it beggar'd all description she did lie in her pavilion cloth of gold of tissue-- o'er picturing that venus where we see the fancy outwork nature on each side her stood pretty dimpled boys like smiling cupids with divers colour'd fans whose wind did seem to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool and what they undid did o rare for antony her gentlewomen like the nereides so many mermaids tended her i the eyes and made their bends adornings at the helm a seeming mermaid steers the silken tackle swell with the touches of those flower soft hands that yarely frame the office from the barge a strange invisible perfume hits the sense of the adjacent wharfs the city cast her people out upon her and antony enthroned i the market place did sit alone whistling to the air which but for vacancy had gone to gaze on cleopatra too and made a gap in nature rare egyptian upon her landing antony sent to her invited her to supper she replied it should be better he became her guest which she entreated our courteous antony whom ne'er the word of no woman heard speak being barber'd ten times o'er goes to the feast and for his ordinary pays his heart for what his eyes eat only royal wench she made great caesar lay his sword to bed he plough'd her and she cropp'd i saw her once hop forty paces through the public street and having lost her breath she spoke and panted that she did make defect perfection and breathless power breathe forth now antony must leave her utterly never he will not age can not wither her nor custom stale her infinite variety other women cloy the appetites they feed but she makes hungry where most she satisfies for vilest things become themselves in her that the holy priests bless her when she is riggish if beauty wisdom modesty can settle the heart of

want having a son and friends since julius caesar who at philippi the good brutus ghosted there saw you labouring for him what was't that moved pale cassius to conspire and what made the all honour'd honest roman brutus with the arm'd rest courtiers and beauteous freedom to drench the capitol but that they would have one man but a man and that is it hath made me rig my navy at whose burthen the anger'd ocean foams with which i meant to scourge the ingratitude that despiteful rome cast on my noble father take your time thou canst not fear us pompey with thy sails we 'll speak with thee at sea at land thou know'st how much we do o'er count thee at land indeed thou dost o'er count me of my father 's house but since the cuckoo builds not for himself remain in't as thou mayst be pleased to

fortune you have made me offer of sicily sardinia and i must rid all the sea of pirates then to send measures of wheat to rome this greed upon to part with unhack'd edges and bear back our targes undinted that 's our offer know then i came before you here a man prepared to take this offer but mark antony put me to some impatience though i lose the praise of it by telling you must know when caesar and your brother were at blows your mother came to sicily and did find her welcome friendly i have heard it pompey and am well studied for a liberal thanks which i do owe you let me have your hand i did not think sir to have met you here the beds i the east are soft and thanks to you that call'd me timelier than my purpose hither for i have gain'd by t. since i saw you last there is a

fair woman has a true face no slander they steal hearts we came hither to fight with you for my part i am sorry it is turned to a drinking pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune if he do sure he can not weep't back again you 've said sir we looked not for mark antony here pray you is he married to cleopatra caesar 's sister is called octavia true sir she was the wife of caius marcellus but she is now the wife of marcus antonius pray ye sir tis true then is caesar and he for ever knit together if i were bound to divine of this unity i would not prophesy so i think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties i think so too but you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity octavia is of a holy cold and still conversation who would not have his wife so not he that himself is not so which is mark antony he will to his egyptian dish again then shall the sighs of octavia blow the fire up in caesar and as i said before that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance antony will use his affection where it is he married but his

menas                  say in mine ear what is't aside to pompey   forsake thy seat i do beseech thee captain and hear me speak a word aside to menas   forbear me till anon this wine for lepidus what manner o thing is your crocodile it is shaped sir like itself and it is as broad as it hath breadth it is just so high as it is and moves with its own organs it lives by that which nourisheth it and the elements once out of it it transmigrates what colour is it of of it own colour too tis a strange serpent tis so and the tears of it are wet will this description satisfy him with the health that pompey gives him else he is a very epicure aside to menas   go hang sir hang tell me of that away do as i bid you where 's this cup i call'd for aside to pompey   if for the sake of merit thou wilt hear me rise from thy stool aside to menas   i think thou'rt mad the matter rises and walks aside i have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes thou hast served me with much faith what 's else to say be

pales or sky inclips is thine if thou wilt ha't show me which way these three world sharers these competitors are in thy vessel let me cut the cable and when we are put off fall to their throats all

repent that e'er thy tongue hath so betray'd thine act being done unknown i should have found it afterwards well done but must condemn it now desist and drink aside   for this i 'll never follow thy

isis that day appear'd and oft before gave audience as tis reported so let rome be thus inform'd who queasy with his insolence already will their good thoughts call from him the people know it and have now received his accusations who does he accuse caesar and that having in sicily sextus pompeius spoil'd we had not rated him his part o the isle then does he say he lent me some shipping unrestored lastly he frets that lepidus of the triumvirate should be deposed and being that we detain all his revenue sir this should be answer'd tis done already and the messenger gone i have told him lepidus was grown too cruel that he his high authority abused and did deserve his change for what i have conquer'd i grant him part but then in his armenia and other of his conquer'd kingdoms i demand the like he 'll never yield to that nor must not then be yielded to in this enter octavia with her train hail caesar and my lord hail most dear caesar that ever i should call thee castaway you

approach long ere she did appear the trees by the way should have borne men and expectation fainted longing for what it had not nay the dust should have ascended to the roof of heaven raised by your populous troops but you are come a market maid to rome and have prevented the ostentation of our love which left unshown is often left unloved we should have met you by sea and land supplying every stage with an augmented greeting good my lord to come thus was i not constrain'd but did on my free will my lord mark antony hearing that you prepared for war acquainted my grieved ear withal whereon i begg'd his pardon for return which soon he granted being an obstruct tween his lust and him do not say so my lord i have eyes upon him and his affairs come to me on the wind where is he now my lord

it if not denounced against us why should not we be there in person aside   well i could reply if we should serve with horse and mares together the horse were merely lost the mares would bear a soldier and his horse what is't you say your presence needs must puzzle antony take from his heart take from his brain from 's time what should not then be spared he is already traduced for levity and tis said in rome that photinus an eunuch and your maids manage this war sink rome and their tongues rot that speak against us a charge we bear i the war and as the president of my kingdom will appear there for a man speak not against it i will not stay behind nay i have done here comes the emperor enter mark antony and canidius is it not strange canidius that from tarentum and brundusium he could so quickly cut the ionian sea and take in toryne you have heard on't sweet celerity is never more admired than by the negligent a good rebuke which might have well becomed the best of men to taunt at slackness canidius we will fight with him by sea by sea what else why will my lord do so for that he dares us to't so hath my lord dared him to single fight ay and to wage this battle at pharsalia where caesar fought with pompey but these offers which serve not for his vantage be shakes off and so should you your ships are not well mann'd your mariners are muleters reapers people ingross'd by swift impress in caesar 's fleet are those that often have gainst pompey fought their ships are yare yours heavy no disgrace shall fall you for refusing him at sea being prepared for land by sea by

forego the way which promises assurance and give up yourself merely to chance and hazard from firm security i 'll fight at sea i have sixty sails caesar none better our overplus of shipping will we burn and with the rest full mann'd from the head of actium beat the approaching caesar but if we fail we then can do't at land enter a messenger thy business the news is true my lord he is descried caesar has taken toryne can he be there in person tis impossible strange that power should be canidius our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land and our twelve thousand horse we 'll to our ship

of egypt,-- whom leprosy o'ertake!--i the midst o the fight when vantage like a pair of twins appear'd both as the same or rather ours the elder the breese upon her like a cow in june hoists sails and flies that i beheld mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not endure a further view she once being loof'd the noble ruin of her magic antony claps on his sea wing and like a doting mallard leaving the fight in height flies after her i never saw an action of such shame experience manhood honour ne'er before did violate so itself alack alack enter canidius our fortune on the sea is out of

you would have follow'd egypt thou knew'st too well my heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings and thou shouldst tow me after o'er my spirit thy full supremacy thou knew'st and that thy beck might from the bidding of the gods command me o my pardon now i must to the young man send humble treaties dodge and palter in the shifts of lowness who with half the bulk o the world play'd as i pleased making and marring fortunes you did know how much you were my conqueror and that my sword made weak by my affection would obey it on all cause pardon pardon fall not a tear i say one of them rates all

she offers blows exeunt scene xii egypt octavius caesar 's camp enter octavius caesar dolabella thyreus with others let him appear that 's come from antony know you him caesar tis his schoolmaster an argument that he is pluck'd when hither he sends so poor a pinion off his wing which had superfluous kings for messengers not many moons gone by enter euphronius ambassador from mark antony approach and speak such as i am i come from antony i was of late as petty to his ends as is the morn dew on the myrtle leaf to his grand sea be't so declare thine office lord of his fortunes he salutes thee and requires to live in egypt which not granted he lessens his requests and to thee sues to let him breathe between the heavens and earth a private man in athens this for him next cleopatra does confess thy greatness submits her to thy might and of thee craves the circle of the ptolemies for her heirs now hazarded to thy grace for antony i have no ears to his request the queen of audience nor desire shall fail so she from egypt drive her all disgraced friend or take his life there this if she perform she shall not sue unheard so to them both fortune pursue thee bring him through the bands exit euphronius to thyreus from antony win cleopatra promise and in our name what she requires add more from thine invention offers women are not in their best fortunes strong but want will perjure the ne'er touch'd vestal try thy cunning thyreus make thine own edict for thy pains which we will answer as a law caesar i go observe how antony becomes his flaw and what thou think'st his very action speaks in every power that moves caesar i shall exeunt scene xiii alexandria cleopatra 's palace enter cleopatra domitius enobarbus charmian and iras what shall we do enobarbus think and die is antony or we in fault for this antony only that would make his will lord of his reason what though you fled from that great face of war whose several ranges frighted each other why should he follow the itch of his affection should not then have nick'd his captainship at such a point when half to half the world opposed he being the meered question twas a shame no less than was his loss to course your flying flags and leave his navy gazing prithee peace enter mark antony with euphronius the ambassador is that his answer ay my lord the queen shall then have courtesy so she will yield us up he says so let her know't to the boy caesar send this grizzled head and he will fill thy wishes to the brim with principalities that head my lord to him again tell him he wears the rose of youth upon him from which the world should note something particular his coin ships legions may be a coward 's whose ministers would prevail under the service of a child as soon as i the command of caesar i dare him therefore to lay his gay comparisons apart and answer me declined sword against sword ourselves alone i 'll write it follow me exeunt mark antony and euphronius aside   yes like enough high battled caesar will unstate his happiness and be staged to the show against a sworder i see men 's judgments are a parcel of their fortunes and things outward do draw the inward quality after them to suffer all alike that he should dream knowing all measures the full caesar will answer his emptiness caesar thou hast subdued his judgment too enter an attendant a messenger from caesar what no more ceremony see my women against the blown rose may they stop their nose that kneel'd unto the buds admit him sir exit attendant aside   mine honesty and i begin to square the loyalty well held to fools does make our faith mere folly yet he that can endure to follow with allegiance a fall'n lord does conquer him that did his master conquer and earns a place i the story enter thyreus caesar 's will hear it apart none but friends say boldly so haply are they friends to antony he needs as many sir as caesar has or needs not us if caesar please our master will leap to be his friend for us you know whose he is we are and that is caesar 's so thus then thou most renown'd caesar entreats not to consider in what case thou stand'st further than he is caesar go on right royal he knows that you embrace not antony as you did love but as you fear'd him o the scars upon your honour therefore he does pity as constrained blemishes not as deserved he is a god and knows what is most right mine honour was not yielded but conquer'd merely aside              to be sure of that i will ask antony sir sir thou art so leaky that we must leave thee to thy sinking for thy dearest quit thee exit shall i say to caesar what you require of him for he partly begs to be desired to give it much would please him that of his fortunes you should make a staff to lean upon but it would warm his spirits to hear from me you had left antony and put yourself under his shrowd the universal landlord what 's your name my name is thyreus most kind messenger say to great caesar this in deputation i kiss his conquering hand tell him i am prompt to lay my crown at 's feet and there to kneel tell him from his all obeying breath i hear the doom of egypt tis your noblest course wisdom and fortune combating together if that the former dare but what it can no chance may shake it give me grace to lay my duty on your hand your caesar 's father oft when he hath mused of taking kingdoms in bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place as it rain'd kisses re enter mark antony and domitius enobarbus favours by jove that thunders what art thou fellow one that but performs the bidding of the fullest man and worthiest to have command obey'd aside                you will be whipp'd approach there ah you kite now gods and devils authority melts from me of late when i cried ho like boys unto a muss kings would start forth and cry your will have you no ears i am antony yet enter attendants take hence this jack and whip him aside   tis better playing with a lion 's whelp than with an old one dying moon and stars whip him were't twenty of the greatest tributaries that do acknowledge caesar should i find them so saucy with the hand of she here,--what 's her name since she was cleopatra whip him fellows till like a boy you see him cringe his face and whine aloud for mercy take him hence mark antony tug him away being whipp'd bring him again this jack of caesar 's shall bear us an errand to him exeunt attendants with thyreus you were half blasted ere i knew you ha have i my pillow left unpress'd in rome forborne the getting of a lawful race and by a gem of women to be abused by one that looks on feeders good my lord,-- you have been a boggler ever but when we in our viciousness grow hard-- o misery on't!--the wise gods seel our eyes in our own filth drop our clear judgments make us adore our errors laugh at 's while we strut to our confusion o is't come to this i found you as a morsel cold upon dead caesar 's trencher nay you were a fragment of cneius pompey 's besides what hotter hours unregister'd in vulgar fame you have luxuriously pick'd out for i am sure though you can guess what temperance should be you know not what it is wherefore is this to let a fellow that will take rewards and say god quit you be familiar with my playfellow your hand this kingly seal and plighter of high hearts o that i were upon the hill of basan to outroar the horned herd for i have savage cause and to proclaim it civilly were like a halter'd neck which does the hangman thank for being yare about him re enter attendants with thyreus is he whipp'd soundly my lord cried he and begg'd a pardon he did ask favour if that thy father live let him repent thou wast not made his daughter and be thou sorry to follow caesar in his triumph since thou hast been whipp'd for following him henceforth the white hand of a lady fever thee shake thou to look on t. get thee back to caesar tell him thy entertainment look thou say he makes me angry with him for he seems proud and disdainful harping on what i am not what he knew i was he makes me angry and at this time most easy tis to do't when my good stars that were my former guides have empty left their orbs and shot their fires into the abysm of hell if he mislike my speech and what is done tell him he has hipparchus my enfranched bondman whom he may at pleasure whip or hang or torture as he shall like to quit me urge it thou hence with thy stripes begone exit thyreus have you done yet alack our terrene moon is now eclipsed and it portends alone the fall of antony i must stay his time to flatter caesar would you mingle eyes with one that ties his points not know me yet cold hearted toward me ah dear if i be so from my cold heart let heaven engender hail and poison it in the source and the first stone drop in my neck as it determines so dissolve my life the next caesarion smite till by degrees the memory of my womb together with my brave egyptians all by the discandying of this pelleted storm lie graveless till the flies and gnats of nile have buried them for prey i am satisfied caesar sits down in alexandria where i will oppose his fate our force by land hath nobly held our sever'd navy too have knit again and fleet threatening most sea like where hast thou been my heart dost thou hear lady if from the field i shall return once more to kiss these lips i will appear in blood i and my sword will earn our chronicle there 's hope in't yet that 's my brave lord i will be treble sinew'd hearted breathed and fight maliciously for when mine hours were nice and lucky men did ransom lives of me for jests but now i 'll set my teeth and send to darkness all that stop me come let 's have one other gaudy night call to me all my sad captains fill our bowls once more let 's mock the midnight bell it is my birth day i had thought to have held it poor but since my lord is antony again i will be cleopatra we will yet do well call all his noble captains to my lord do so we 'll speak to them and to night i 'll force the wine peep through their scars come on my queen there 's sap in't yet the next time i do fight i 'll make death love me for i will contend even with his pestilent scythe exeunt all but domitius enobarbus now he 'll outstare the lightning to be furious is to be frighted out of fear and in that mood the dove will peck the estridge and i see still a diminution in our captain 's brain restores his heart when valour preys on reason it eats the sword it fights with i will seek some way to leave him exit act iv scene i. before alexandria octavius caesar 's camp enter octavius caesar agrippa and mecaenas with his army

something blown the like is on her arm this is an aspic 's trail and these fig leaves have slime upon them such as the aspic leaves upon the caves of nile most probable that so she died for her

we know't let us kill him and we 'll have corn at our own price is't a verdict no more talking on't let it be done away away one word good citizens we are accounted poor citizens the patricians good what authority surfeits on would relieve us if they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely but they think we are too dear the leanness that afflicts us the object of our misery is as an inventory to particularise their abundance our sufferance is a gain to them let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become rakes for the gods know i speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge would you proceed especially against caius marcius against him first he 's a very dog to the commonalty consider you what services he has done for his country very well and could be content to give him good report fort but that he pays himself with being proud nay but speak not maliciously i say unto you what he hath done famously he did it to that end though soft conscienced men can be content to say it was for his country he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud which he is even till the altitude of his virtue what he can not help in his nature you account a vice in him you must in no way say he is covetous if i must not i need not be barren of accusations he hath faults with surplus to tire in repetition shouts within

friends mine honest neighbours will you undo yourselves we can not sir we are undone already i tell you friends most charitable care have the patricians of you for your wants your suffering in this dearth you may as well strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them against the roman state whose course will on the way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs of more strong link asunder than can ever appear in your impediment for the dearth the gods not the patricians make it and your knees to them not arms must help alack you are transported by calamity thither where more attends you and you slander the helms o the state who care for you like fathers when you curse them as enemies care for us true indeed they ne'er cared for us yet suffer us to famish and their store houses crammed with grain make edicts for usury to support usurers repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich and provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor if the wars eat us not up they will and there 's all the love they bear us either you must confess yourselves wondrous malicious or be accused of folly i shall tell you a pretty tale it may be you have heard it but since it serves my purpose i will venture to stale t a little more well i 'll hear it sir yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale but an t please you deliver there was a time when all the body 's members rebell'd against the belly thus accused it that only like a gulf it did remain i the midst o the body idle and unactive still cupboarding the viand never bearing like labour with the rest where the other instruments did see and hear devise instruct walk feel and mutually participate did minister unto the appetite and affection common of the whole body the belly answer'd-- well sir what answer made the belly sir i shall tell you with a kind of smile which ne'er came from the lungs but even thus-- for look you i may make the belly smile as well as speak it tauntingly replied to the discontented members the mutinous parts that envied his receipt even so most fitly as you malign our senators for that they are not such as you your belly 's answer what the kingly crowned head the vigilant eye the counsellor heart the arm our soldier our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter with other muniments and petty helps in this our fabric if that they-- what then fore me this fellow speaks what then what then should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd who is the sink o the body,-- well what then the former agents if they did complain what could the belly answer i will tell you if you 'll bestow a small of what you have little-- patience awhile you 'll hear the belly 's answer ye're long about it note me this good friend your most grave belly was deliberate not rash like his accusers and thus answer'd true is it my incorporate friends quoth he that i receive the general food at first which you do live upon and fit it is because i am the store house and the shop of the whole body but if you do remember i send it through the rivers of your blood even to the court the heart to the seat o the brain and through the cranks and offices of man the strongest nerves and small inferior veins from me receive that natural competency whereby they live and though that all at once you my good friends,'--this says the belly mark me,-- ay sir well well though all at once can not see what i do deliver out to each yet i can make my audit up that all from me do back receive the flour of all and leave me but the bran what say you to't it was an answer how apply you this the senators of rome are this good belly and you the mutinous members for examine their counsels and their cares digest things rightly touching the weal o the common you shall find no public benefit which you receive but it proceeds or comes from them to you and no way from yourselves what do you think you the great toe of this assembly i the great toe why the great toe for that being one o the lowest basest poorest of this most wise rebellion thou go'st foremost thou rascal that art worst in blood to run lead'st first to win some vantage but make you ready your stiff bats and clubs rome and her rats are at the point of battle the one side must have bale enter caius marcius hail noble marcius thanks what 's the matter you dissentious rogues that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion make yourselves scabs we have ever your good word he that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring what would you have you curs that like nor peace nor war the one affrights you the other makes you proud he that trusts to you where he should find you lions finds you hares where foxes geese you are no surer no than is the coal of fire upon the ice or hailstone in the sun your virtue is to make him worthy whose offence subdues him and curse that justice did it who deserves greatness deserves your hate and your affections are a sick man 's appetite who desires most that which would increase his evil he that depends upon your favours swims with fins of lead and hews down oaks with rushes hang ye trust ye with every minute you do change a mind and call him noble that was now your hate him vile that was your garland what 's the matter that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate who under the gods keep you in awe which else would feed on one another what 's their seeking for corn at their own rates whereof they say the city is well stored hang 'em they say they 'll sit by the fire and presume to know what 's done i the capitol who 's like to rise who thrives and who declines side factions and give out conjectural marriages making parties strong and feebling such as stand not in their liking below their cobbled shoes they say there 's grain enough would the nobility lay aside their ruth and let me use my sword i 'll make a quarry with thousands of these quarter'd slaves as high as i could pick my lance nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded for though abundantly they lack discretion yet are they passing cowardly but i beseech you what says the other troop they are dissolved hang 'em they said they were an hungry sigh'd forth proverbs that hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat that meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not corn for the rich men only with these shreds they vented their complainings which being answer'd and a petition granted them a strange one-- to break the heart of generosity and make bold power look pale they threw their caps as they would hang them on the horns o the moon shouting their emulation what is granted them five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms of their own choice one 's junius brutus sicinius velutus and i know not--'sdeath the rabble should have first unroof'd the city ere so prevail'd with me it will in time win upon power and throw forth greater themes for insurrection 's arguing this is strange go get you home you fragments enter a messenger hastily where 's caius marcius here what 's the matter the news is sir the volsces are in arms i am glad on t then we shall ha means to vent our musty superfluity see our best elders enter cominius titus lartius and other senators junius brutus and sicinius velutus marcius tis true that you have lately told us the volsces are in arms they have a leader tullus aufidius that will put you to t. i sin in envying his nobility and were i any thing but what i am i would wish me only he you have fought together were half to half the world by the ears and he upon my party i'ld revolt to make only my wars with him he is a lion that i am proud to hunt then worthy marcius attend upon cominius to these wars it is your former promise sir it is and i am constant titus lartius thou shalt see me once more strike at tullus face what art thou stiff stand'st out no caius marcius i 'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other ere stay behind this business o true bred your company to the capitol where i know our greatest friends attend us to cominius                 lead you on to marcius right worthy you priority noble marcius to the citizens   hence to your homes be gone nay let them follow the volsces have much corn take these rats thither to gnaw their garners worshipful mutiners your valour puts well forth pray follow citizens steal away exeunt all but sicinius and brutus was ever man so proud as is this marcius he has no equal when we were chosen tribunes for the people,-- mark'd you his lip and eyes nay but his taunts being moved he will not spare to gird the gods be mock the modest moon the present wars devour him he is grown too proud to be so valiant such a nature tickled with good success disdains the shadow which he treads on at noon but i do wonder his insolence can brook to be commanded under cominius fame at the which he aims in whom already he 's well graced can not better be held nor more attain'd than by a place below the first for what miscarries shall be the general 's fault though he perform to the utmost of a man and giddy censure will then cry out of marcius o if he had borne the business besides if things go well opinion that so sticks on marcius shall of his demerits rob cominius come half all cominius honours are to marcius though marcius earned them not and all his faults to marcius shall be honours though indeed in aught he merit not let 's hence and hear how the dispatch is made and in what fashion more than his singularity he goes upon this present action lets along exeunt scene ii corioli the senate house enter tullus aufidius and certain senators so your opinion is aufidius that they of rome are entered in our counsels and know how we proceed is it not yours what ever have been thought on in this state that could be brought to bodily act ere rome had circumvention tis not four days gone since i heard thence these are the words i think i have the letter here yes here it is reads they have press'd a power but it is not known whether for east or west the dearth is great the people mutinous and it is rumour'd cominius marcius your old enemy who is of rome worse hated than of you and titus lartius a most valiant roman these three lead on this preparation whither tis bent most likely tis for you consider of it our army 's in the field we never yet made doubt but rome was ready to answer us nor did you think it folly to keep your great pretences veil'd till when they needs must show themselves which in the hatching it seem'd appear'd to rome by the discovery we shall be shorten'd in our aim which was to take in many towns ere almost rome should know we were afoot noble aufidius take your commission hie you to your bands let us alone to guard corioli if they set down before 's for the remove bring your army but i think you 'll find they 've not prepared for us o doubt not that i speak from certainties nay more some parcels of their power are forth already and only hitherward i leave your honours if we and caius marcius chance to meet tis sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more the gods assist you and keep your honours safe farewell farewell farewell

of my womb when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way when for a day of kings entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding i considering how honour would become such a person that it was no better than picture like to hang by the wall if renown made it not stir was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame to a cruel war i sent him from whence he returned his brows bound with oak i tell thee daughter i sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man but had he died in the business madam how then then his good report should have been my son i therein would have found issue hear me profess sincerely had i a dozen sons each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my

he let it go again and after it again and over and over he comes and again catched it again or whether his fall enraged him or how twas he did so set his teeth and tear it o i warrant it how he mammocked it one on 's father 's moods indeed la tis a noble child a crack madam come lay aside your stitchery i must have you play the idle husewife with me this afternoon no good madam i will not

heaven i 'll leave the foe and make my wars on you look to't come on if you 'll stand fast we 'll beat them to their wives as they us to our trenches followed another alarum the volsces fly and

thou art left marcius a carbuncle entire as big as thou art were not so rich a jewel thou wast a soldier even to cato 's wish not fierce and terrible only in strokes but with thy grim looks and the thunder like percussion of thy sounds thou madst thine enemies shake as if the world were feverous and did tremble re enter marcius bleeding assaulted by the enemy look sir o,'tis marcius let 's fetch

aufidius piercing our romans then valiant titus take convenient numbers to make good the city whilst i with those that have the spirit will haste to help cominius worthy sir thou bleed'st thy exercise hath been too violent for a second course of fight sir praise me not my work hath yet not warm'd me fare you well the blood i drop is rather physical than dangerous to me to aufidius thus i will appear and fight now the fair goddess fortune fall deep in love with thee and her great charms misguide thy opposers swords bold gentleman prosperity be thy page thy friend no less than those she

powers with smiling fronts encountering may give you thankful sacrifice enter a messenger thy news the citizens of corioli have issued and given to lartius and to marcius battle i saw our party to their trenches driven and then i came away though thou speak'st truth methinks thou speak'st not well how long is't since above an hour my lord tis not a mile briefly we heard their drums how couldst thou in a mile confound an hour and bring thy news so late spies of the volsces held me in chase that i was forced to wheel three or four miles about else had i sir half an hour since brought my report who 's yonder that does appear as he were flay'd o gods he has the stamp of marcius and i have before time seen him thus within                  come i too late the shepherd knows not thunder

arms as sound as when i woo'd in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done and tapers burn'd to bedward flower of warriors how is it with titus lartius as with a man busied about decrees condemning some to death and some to exile ransoming him or pitying threatening the other holding corioli in the name of rome even like a fawning greyhound in the leash to let him slip at will where is that slave which told me they had beat you to your trenches where is he call him hither let him alone he did inform the truth but for our gentlemen the common file a plague tribunes for them!-- the mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge from rascals worse than they but how prevail'd you will the time serve to tell i do not think where is the enemy are you lords o the field if not why cease you till you are so marcius we have at disadvantage fought and did retire to win our purpose how lies their battle know you on which side they have placed their men of trust as i guess marcius their bands i the vaward are the antiates of their best trust o'er them aufidius their very heart of hope i do beseech you by all the battles wherein we have fought by the blood we have shed together

the hungry plebeians would the noble marcius he 's a lamb indeed that baes like a bear he 's a bear indeed that lives like a lamb you two are old men tell me one thing that i shall ask you well sir in what enormity is marcius poor in that you two have not in abundance he 's poor in no one fault but stored with all especially in pride and topping all others in boasting this is strange now do you two know how you are censured here in the city i mean of us o the right hand file do you why how are we censured because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry well well sir well why tis no great matter for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so you blame marcius for being proud we do it not alone sir i know you can do very little alone for your helps are many or else your actions would grow wondrous single your abilities are too infant like for doing much alone you talk of pride o that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves o that you could what then sir why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as any in rome menenius you are known well enough too i am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying tiber in't said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty and tinder like upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning what i think i utter and spend my malice in my breath meeting two such wealsmen as you are i can not call you lycurguses if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely i make a crooked face at it i ca n't say your worships have delivered the matter well when i find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables and though i must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you you have good faces if you see this in the map of my microcosm follows it that i am known well enough too what barm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if i be known well enough too come sir come we know you well enough you know neither me yourselves nor any thing you are ambitious for poor knaves caps and legs you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange wife and a fosset seller and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a second day of audience when you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinched with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamber pot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing all the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves you are a pair of strange ones come come you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the capitol our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are when you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher 's cushion or to be entombed in an ass 's pack- saddle yet you must be saying marcius is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth predecessors since deucalion though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary hangmen god den to your worships more of your conversation would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians i will be bold to take my leave of you brutus and sicinius go

victory in his pocket the wounds become him on 's brows menenius he comes the third time home with the oaken garland has he disciplined aufidius soundly titus lartius writes they fought together but aufidius got off and twas time for him too i 'll warrant him that an he had stayed by him i would not have been so fidiused for all the chests in corioli and the gold that 's in them is the senate possessed of this good ladies let 's go yes yes yes the senate has letters from the general wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war he hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly in troth there 's wondrous things spoke of him wondrous ay i warrant you and not without his true purchasing the gods grant them true true pow wow true i 'll be sworn they are true where is he wounded to the tribunes god save your good worships marcius is coming home he has more cause to be proud where is he wounded i the shoulder and i the left arm there will be large cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place he received in the repulse of tarquin seven hurts i the body one i the neck and two i the thigh,--there 's nine that i know he had before this last expedition twenty five wounds upon him now it 's twenty seven every gash was an enemy 's grave a shout and flourish hark the trumpets these are the ushers of marcius before him he carries noise and behind him he leaves

o thy wife my gracious silence hail wouldst thou have laugh'd had i come coffin'd home that weep'st to see me triumph ay my dear such eyes the widows in corioli wear and mothers that lack sons now the gods crown thee and live you yet to valeria o my sweet lady pardon i know not where to turn o welcome home and welcome general and ye're welcome all a hundred thousand welcomes i could weep and i could laugh i am light and heavy welcome a curse begin at very root on 's heart that is not glad to see thee you are three that rome should dote on yet by the faith of men we have some old crab trees here at home that will not be grafted to your relish yet welcome warriors we call a nettle but a nettle and the faults of fools but folly ever right menenius ever ever give way there and go on to volumnia and virgilia   your hand and yours ere in our own house i do shade my head the good patricians must be visited from whom i have received not only greetings but with them change of honours i have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy only there 's one thing wanting which i doubt not but our rome will cast upon thee know good mother i had rather be their servant in my way than sway with them in theirs on to the capitol flourish cornets exeunt in state as before brutus and sicinius come forward all tongues speak of him and the bleared sights are spectacled to see him your prattling nurse into a rapture lets her baby cry while she chats him the kitchen malkin pins her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck clambering the walls to eye him stalls bulks windows are smother'd up leads fill'd and ridges horsed with variable complexions all agreeing in earnestness to see him seld shown flamens do press among the popular throngs and puff to win a vulgar station or veil'd dames commit the war of white and damask in their nicely gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil of phoebus burning kisses such a pother as if that whatsoever god who leads him were slily crept into his human powers and gave him graceful posture on the sudden i warrant him consul then our office may during his power go sleep he can not temperately transport his honours from where he should begin and end but will lose those he hath won in that there 's comfort doubt not the commoners for whom we stand but they upon their ancient malice will forget with the least cause these his new honours which that he will give them make i as little question as he is proud to do't i heard him swear were he to stand for consul never would he appear i the market place nor on him put the napless vesture of humility nor showing as the manner is his wounds to the people beg their stinking breaths tis right it was his word o he would miss it rather than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him and the desire of the nobles i wish no better than have him hold that purpose and to put it in execution tis most like he will it shall be to him then as our good wills a sure destruction so it must fall out to him or our authorities for an end we must suggest the people in what hatred he still hath held them that to 's power he would have made them mules silenced their pleaders and dispropertied their freedoms holding them in human action and capacity of no more soul nor fitness for the world than camels in the war who have their provand only for bearing burdens and sore blows for sinking under them this as you say suggested at some time when his soaring insolence shall touch the people which time shall not want if he be put upon t and that 's as easy as to set dogs on sheep will be his fire to kindle their dry stubble and their blaze shall darken him for ever enter a messenger what 's the matter you are sent for to the capitol tis thought that marcius shall be consul i have seen the dumb men throng to see him and the blind to bear him speak matrons flung gloves ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers upon him as he pass'd the nobles bended as to jove 's statue and the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts i never saw the like let 's to the capitol and carry with us ears and eyes for the time but hearts for the event have with you exeunt scene ii the same the capitol enter two officers to lay cushions come come they are almost here how many stand for consulships three they say but tis thought of every one coriolanus will carry it that 's a brave fellow but he 's vengeance proud and loves not the common people faith there had been many great men that have flattered the people who ne'er loved them and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore so that if they love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground therefore for coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly see't if he did not care whether he had their love or no he waved indifferently twixt doing them neither good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes to flatter them for their love he hath deserved worthily of his country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been supple and courteous to the people bonneted without any further deed to have them at an into their estimation and report but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury to report otherwise were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it no more of him he is a worthy man make way they are coming a sennet enter with actors before them cominius   the consul menenius coriolanus senators   sicinius and brutus the senators take their   places the tribunes take their places by themselves coriolanus stands having determined of the volsces and to send for titus lartius it remains as the main point of this our after meeting to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country therefore please you most reverend and grave elders to desire the present consul and last general in our well found successes to report a little of that worthy work perform'd by caius marcius coriolanus whom we met here both to thank and to remember with honours like himself speak good cominius leave nothing out for length and make us think rather our state 's defective for requital than we to stretch it out to the tribunes masters o the people we do request your kindest ears and after your loving motion toward the common body to yield what passes here we are convented upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts inclinable to honour and advance the theme of our assembly which the rather we shall be blest to do if he remember a kinder value of the people than he hath hereto prized them at that 's off that 's off i would you rather had been silent please you to hear cominius speak most willingly but yet my caution was more pertinent than the rebuke you give it he loves your people but tie him not to be their bedfellow worthy cominius speak coriolanus offers to go away nay keep your place sit coriolanus never shame to hear what you have nobly done your horror 's pardon i had rather have my wounds to heal again than hear say how i got them sir i hope my words disbench'd you not no sir yet oft when blows have made me stay i fled from words you soothed not therefore hurt not but your people i love them as they weigh pray now sit down i had rather have one scratch my head i the sun when the alarum were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monster'd exit masters of the people your multiplying spawn how can he flatter-- that 's thousand to one good one when you now see he had rather venture all his limbs for honour than one on 's ears to hear it proceed cominius i shall lack voice the deeds of coriolanus should not be utter'd feebly it is held that valour is the chiefest virtue and most dignifies the haver if it be the man i speak of can not in the world be singly counterpoised at sixteen years when tarquin made a head for rome he fought beyond the mark of others our then dictator whom with all praise i point at saw him fight when with his amazonian chin he drove the bristled lips before him be bestrid an o'er press'd roman and i the consul 's view slew three opposers tarquin 's self he met and struck him on his knee in that day 's feats when he might act the woman in the scene he proved best man i the field and for his meed was brow bound with the oak his pupil age man enter'd thus he waxed like a sea and in the brunt of seventeen battles since he lurch'd all swords of the garland for this last before and in corioli let me say i can not speak him home he stopp'd the fliers and by his rare example made the coward turn terror into sport as weeds before a vessel under sail so men obey'd and fell below his stem his sword death 's stamp where it did mark it took from face to foot he was a thing of blood whose every motion was timed with dying cries alone he enter'd the mortal gate of the city which he painted with shunless destiny aidless came off and with a sudden reinforcement struck corioli like a planet now all 's his when by and by the din of war gan pierce his ready sense then straight his doubled spirit re quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate and to the battle came he where he did run reeking o'er the lives of men as if twere a perpetual spoil and till we call'd both field and city ours he never stood to ease his breast with panting worthy man he can not but with measure fit the honours which we devise him our spoils he kick'd at and look'd upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world he covets less than misery itself would give rewards his deeds with doing them and is content to spend the time to end it he 's right noble let him be call'd for call coriolanus he doth appear re enter coriolanus the senate coriolanus are well pleased to make thee consul i do owe them still my life and services it then remains that you do speak to the people i do beseech you let me o'erleap that custom for i can not put on the gown stand naked and entreat them for my wounds sake to give their suffrage please you that i may pass this doing sir the people must have their voices neither will they bate one jot of ceremony put them not to't pray you go fit you to the custom and take to you as your predecessors have your honour with your form it is apart that i shall blush in acting and might well be taken from the people mark you that to brag unto them thus i did and thus show them the unaching scars which i should hide as if i had received them for the hire of their breath only do not stand upon't we recommend to you tribunes of the people our purpose to them and to our noble consul wish we all joy and honour to coriolanus come all joy and honour flourish of cornets exeunt all but sicinius and brutus you see how he intends to use the people may they perceive 's intent he will require them as if he did contemn what he requested should be in them to give come we 'll inform them of our proceedings here on the marketplace i know they do attend us exeunt scene iii the same the forum enter seven or eight citizens once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him we may sir if we will we have power in ourselves to do it but it is a power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them so if he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them ingratitude is monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous members and to make us no better thought of a little help will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck not to call us the many headed multitude we have been called so of many not that our heads are some brown some black some auburn some bald but that our wits are so diversely coloured and truly i think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o the compass think you so which way do you judge my wit would fly nay your wit will not so soon out as another man 's will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block head but if it were at liberty twould sure southward why that way to lose itself in a fog where being three parts melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return for conscience sake to help to get thee a wife you are never without your tricks you may you may are you all resolved to give your voices but that 's no matter the greater part carries it i say if he would incline to the people there was never a worthier man enter coriolanus in a gown of humility with menenius here he comes and in the gown of humility mark his behavior we are not to stay all together but to come by him where he stands by ones by twos and by threes he 's to make his requests by particulars wherein every one of us has a single honour in giving him our own voices with our own tongues therefore follow me and i direct you how you shall go by him content content exeunt citizens o sir you are not right have you not known the worthiest men have done't what must i say i pray sir'--plague upon't i can not bring my tongue to such a pace:--'look sir my wounds i got them in my country 's service when some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran from the noise of our own drums o me the gods you must not speak of that you must desire them to think upon you think upon me hang 'em i would they would forget me like the virtues which our divines lose by 'em you 'll mar all i 'll leave you pray you speak to 'em i pray you in wholesome manner exit bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean re enter two of the citizens so here comes a brace re enter a third citizen you know the cause air of my standing here we do sir tell us what hath brought you to't mine own desert your own desert ay but not mine own desire how not your own desire no sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging you must think if we give you any thing we hope to gain by you well then i pray your price o the consulship the price is to ask it kindly kindly sir i pray let me ha't i have wounds to show you which shall be yours in private your good voice sir what say you you shall ha it worthy sir a match sir there 's in all two worthy voices begged i have your alms adieu but this is something odd an twere to give again,--but tis no matter exeunt the three citizens re enter two other citizens pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your voices that i may be consul i have here the customary gown you have deserved nobly of your country and you have not deserved nobly your enigma you have been a scourge to her enemies you have been a rod to her friends you have not indeed loved the common people you should account me the more virtuous that i have not been common in my love i will sir flatter my sworn brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them tis a condition they account gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart i will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly that is sir i will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers therefore beseech you i may be consul we hope to find you our friend and therefore give you our voices heartily you have received many wounds for your country i will not seal your knowledge with showing them i will make much of your voices and so trouble you no further the gods give you joy sir heartily exeunt most sweet voices better it is to die better to starve than crave the hire which first we do deserve why in this woolvish toge should i stand here to beg of hob and dick that do appear their needless vouches custom calls me to't what custom wills in all things should we do't the dust on antique time would lie unswept and mountainous error be too highly heapt for truth to o'er peer rather than fool it so let the high office and the honour go to one that would do thus i am half through the one part suffer'd the other will i do re enter three citizens more here come more voices your voices for your voices i have fought watch'd for your voices for your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six i have seen and heard of for your voices have done many things some less some more your voices indeed i would be consul he has done nobly and can not go without any honest man 's voice therefore let him be consul the gods give him joy and make him good friend to the people amen amen god save thee noble consul exeunt worthy voices re enter menenius with brutus and sicinius you have stood your limitation and the tribunes endue you with the people 's voice remains that in the official marks invested you anon do meet the senate is this done the custom of request you have discharged the people do admit you and are summon'd to meet anon upon your approbation where at the senate house there coriolanus may i change these garments you may sir that i 'll straight do and knowing myself again repair to the senate house i 'll keep you company will you along we stay here for the people fare you well exeunt coriolanus and menenius he has it now and by his looks methink tis warm at 's heart with a proud heart he wore his humble weeds will you dismiss the people re enter citizens how now my masters have you chose this man he has our voices sir we pray the gods he may deserve your loves amen sir to my poor unworthy notice he mock'd us when he begg'd our voices certainly he flouted us downright no,'tis his kind of speech he did not mock us not one amongst us save yourself but says he used us scornfully he should have show'd us his marks of merit wounds received for 's country why so he did i am sure no no no man saw 'em he said he had wounds which he could show in private and with his hat thus waving it in scorn i would be consul says he aged custom but by your voices will not so permit me your voices therefore when we granted that here was i thank you for your voices thank you your most sweet voices now you have left your voices i have no further with you was not this mockery why either were you ignorant to see't or seeing it of such childish friendliness to yield your voices could you not have told him as you were lesson'd when he had no power but was a petty servant to the state he was your enemy ever spake against your liberties and the charters that you bear i the body of the weal and now arriving a place of potency and sway o the state if he should still malignantly remain fast foe to the plebeii your voices might be curses to yourselves you should have said that as his worthy deeds did claim no less than what he stood for so his gracious nature would think upon you for your voices and translate his malice towards you into love standing your friendly lord thus to have said as you were fore advised had touch'd his spirit and tried his inclination from him pluck'd either his gracious promise which you might as cause had call'd you up have held him to or else it would have gall'd his surly nature which easily endures not article tying him to aught so putting him to rage you should have ta'en the advantage of his choler and pass'd him unelected did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush why had your bodies no heart among you or had you tongues to cry against the rectorship of judgment have you ere now denied the asker and now again of him that did not ask but mock bestow your sued for tongues he 's not confirm'd we may deny him yet and will deny him i 'll have five hundred voices of that sound i twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties make them of no more voice than dogs that are as often beat for barking as therefore kept to do so let them assemble and on a safer judgment all revoke your ignorant election enforce his pride and his old hate unto you besides forget not with what contempt he wore the humble weed how in his suit he scorn'd you but your loves thinking upon his services took from you the apprehension of his present portance which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion after the inveterate hate he bears you lay a fault on us your tribunes that we laboured no impediment between but that you must cast your election on him say you chose him more after our commandment than as guided by your own true affections and that your minds preoccupied with what you rather must do than what you should made you against the grain to voice him consul lay the fault on us ay spare us not say we read lectures to you how youngly he began to serve his country how long continued and what stock he springs of the noble house o the marcians from whence came that ancus marcius numa 's daughter 's son who after great hostilius here was king of the same house publius and quintus were that our beat water brought by conduits hither and   censorinus   nobly named so twice being   by the people chosen   censor was his great ancestor one thus descended that hath beside well in his person wrought to be set high in place we did commend to your remembrances but you have found scaling his present bearing with his past that he 's your fixed enemy and revoke your sudden approbation say you ne'er had done't-- harp on that still but by our putting on and presently when you have drawn your number repair to the capitol we will so almost all repent in their election exeunt citizens let them go on this mutiny were better put in hazard than stay past doubt for greater if as his nature is he fall in rage with their refusal both observe and answer the vantage of his anger to the capitol come we will be there before the stream o the people and this shall seem as partly tis their own which we have goaded onward exeunt act iii scene i. rome a street cornets enter coriolanus menenius all the gentry cominius titus lartius and other senators tullus aufidius then had made new head he had my lord and that it was which caused our swifter composition so then the volsces stand but as at first ready when time shall prompt them to make road upon 's again they are worn lord consul so that we shall hardly in our ages see their banners wave again saw you aufidius on safe guard he   came to me and did curse against the volsces for they had so vilely yielded the town he is retired to antium spoke he of me he did my lord how what how often he had met you sword to sword that of all things upon the earth he hated your person most that he would pawn his fortunes to hopeless restitution so he might be call'd your vanquisher at antium lives he at antium i wish i had a cause to seek him there to oppose his hatred fully welcome home enter sicinius and brutus behold these are the tribunes of the people the tongues o the common mouth i do despise them for they do prank them in authority against all noble sufferance pass no further ha what is that it will be dangerous to go on no further what makes this change the matter hath he not pass'd the noble and the common cominius no have i had children 's voices tribunes give way he shall to the market place the people are incensed against him stop or all will fall in broil are these your herd must these have voices that can yield them now and straight disclaim their tongues what are your offices you being their mouths why rule you not their teeth have you not set them on be calm be calm it is a purposed thing and grows by plot to curb the will of the nobility suffer't and live with such as can not rule nor ever will be ruled call't not a plot the people cry you mock'd them and of late when corn was given them gratis you repined scandal'd the suppliants for the people call'd them time pleasers flatterers foes to nobleness why this was known before not to them all have you inform'd them sithence how i inform them you are like to do such business not unlike each way to better yours why then should i be consul by yond clouds let me deserve so ill as you and make me your fellow tribune you show too much of that for which the people stir if you will pass to where you are bound you must inquire your way which you are out of with a gentler spirit or never be so noble as a consul nor yoke with him for tribune let 's be calm the people are abused set on this paltering becomes not rome nor has coriolanus deserved this so dishonour'd rub laid falsely i the plain way of his merit tell me of corn this was my speech and i will speak't again-- not now not now not in this heat sir now now as i live i will my nobler friends i crave their pardons for the mutable rank scented many let them regard me as i do not flatter and therein behold themselves i say again in soothing them we nourish gainst our senate the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition which we ourselves have plough'd for sow'd and scatter'd by mingling them with us the honour'd number who lack not virtue no nor power but that which they have given to beggars well no more no more words we beseech you how no more as for my country i have shed my blood not fearing outward force so shall my lungs coin words till their decay against those measles which we disdain should tatter us yet sought the very way to catch them you speak o the people as if you were a god to punish not a man of their infirmity twere well we let the people know't what what his choler choler were i as patient as the midnight sleep by jove twould be my mind it is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is not poison any further shall remain hear you this triton of the minnows mark you his absolute shall twas from the canon shall o good but most unwise patricians why you grave but reckless senators have you thus given hydra here to choose an officer that with his peremptory shall being but the horn and noise o the monster 's wants not spirit to say he 'll turn your current in a ditch and make your channel his if he have power then vail your ignorance if none awake your dangerous lenity if you are learn'd be not as common fools if you are not let them have cushions by you you are plebeians if they be senators and they are no less when both your voices blended the great'st taste most palates theirs they choose their magistrate and such a one as he who puts his shall his popular shall against a graver bench than ever frown in greece by jove himself it makes the consuls base and my soul aches to know when two authorities are up neither supreme how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other well on to the market place whoever gave that counsel to give forth the corn o the storehouse gratis as twas used sometime in greece,-- well well no more of that though there the people had more absolute power i say they nourish'd disobedience fed the ruin of the state why shall the people give one that speaks thus their voice i 'll give my reasons more worthier than their voices they know the corn was not our recompense resting well assured that ne'er did service for't being press'd to the war even when the navel of the state was touch'd they would not thread the gates this kind of service did not deserve corn gratis being i the war their mutinies and revolts wherein they show'd most valour spoke not for them the accusation which they have often made against the senate all cause unborn could never be the motive of our so frank donation well what then how shall this bisson multitude digest the senate 's courtesy let deeds express what 's like to be their words we did request it we are the greater poll and in true fear they gave us our demands thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears which will in time break ope the locks o the senate and bring in the crows to peck the eagles come enough enough with over measure no take more what may be sworn by both divine and human seal what i end withal this double worship where one part does disdain with cause the other insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom can not conclude but by the yea and no of general ignorance,--it must omit real necessities and give way the while to unstable slightness purpose so barr'd it follows nothing is done to purpose therefore beseech you,-- you that will be less fearful than discreet that love the fundamental part of state more than you doubt the change on't that prefer a noble life before a long and wish to jump a body with a dangerous physic that 's sure of death without it at once pluck out the multitudinous tongue let them not lick the sweet which is their poison your dishonour mangles true judgment and bereaves the state of that integrity which should become't not having the power to do the good it would for the in which doth control't has said enough has spoken like a traitor and shall answer as traitors do thou wretch despite o'erwhelm thee what should the people do with these bald tribunes on whom depending their obedience fails to the greater bench in a rebellion when what 's not meet but what must be was law then were they chosen in a better hour let what is meet be said it must be meet and throw their power i the dust manifest treason this a consul no the aediles ho enter an aedile let him be apprehended go call the people exit aedile in whose name myself attach thee as a traitorous innovator a foe to the public weal obey i charge thee and follow to thine answer hence old

crying tribunes patricians citizens what ho sicinius brutus coriolanus citizens peace peace peace stay hold peace what is about to be i am out of breath confusion 's near i can not speak you tribunes to the people coriolanus patience speak good sicinius hear me people peace let 's hear our tribune peace speak speak speak you are at point to lose your liberties marcius would have all from you marcius whom late you have named for consul fie fie fie this is the way to kindle not to quench to unbuild the city and to lay all flat what is the city but the people true the people are the city by the consent of all we were establish'd the people 's magistrates you so remain and so are like to do that is the way to lay the city flat to bring the roof to the foundation and bury all which yet distinctly ranges in heaps and piles of ruin this deserves death or let us stand to our authority or let us lose it we do here pronounce upon the part o the people in whose power we were elected theirs marcius is worthy of present death therefore lay hold of him bear him to the rock tarpeian and from thence into destruction cast him aediles seize him yield marcius yield hear me one word beseech you tribunes hear me but a word peace peace to brutus   be that you seem truly your country 's friend and temperately proceed to what you would thus violently redress sir those cold ways that seem like prudent helps are very poisonous where the disease is violent lay hands upon him and bear him to the rock no i 'll die here drawing his sword there 's some among you have beheld me fighting come try upon yourselves what you have seen me down with that sword tribunes withdraw awhile lay hands upon him help marcius help you that be noble help him young and old down with him down with him in this mutiny the tribunes the aediles and the people are beat in go get you to your house be gone away all will be naught else get you gone stand fast we have as many friends as enemies sham it be put to that the gods forbid i prithee noble friend home to thy house leave us to cure this cause for tis a sore upon us you can not tent yourself be gone beseech you come sir along with us i would they were barbarians as they are though in rome litter'd not romans as they are not though calved i the porch o the capitol-- be gone put not your worthy rage into your tongue one time will owe another on fair ground i could beat forty of them i could myself take up a brace o the best of them yea the two tribunes but now tis odds beyond arithmetic and manhood is call'd foolery when it stands against a falling fabric will you hence before the tag return whose rage doth rend like interrupted waters and o'erbear what they are used to bear pray you be gone i 'll try whether my old wit be in request with those that have but little this must be patch'd with cloth of any colour nay come away exeunt coriolanus cominius and others this man has marr'd his fortune his nature is too noble for the world he would not flatter neptune for his trident or jove for 's power to thunder his heart 's his mouth what his breast forges that his tongue must vent and being angry does forget that ever he heard the name of death a noise within here 's goodly work i would they were abed i would they were in tiber what the vengeance could he not speak 'em fair re enter brutus and sicinius with the rabble where is this viper that would depopulate the city and be every man himself you worthy tribunes,-- he shall be thrown down the tarpeian rock with rigorous hands he hath resisted law and therefore law shall scorn him further trial than the severity of the public power which he so sets at nought he shall well know the noble tribunes are the people 's mouths and we their hands he shall sure on't sir sir,-- peace do not cry havoc where you should but hunt with modest warrant sir how comes't that you have holp to make this rescue hear me speak as i do know the consul 's worthiness so can i name his faults,-- consul what consul the consul coriolanus he consul no no no no no if by the tribunes leave and yours good people i may be heard i would crave a word or two the which shall turn you to no further harm than so much loss of time speak briefly then for we are peremptory to dispatch this viperous traitor to eject him hence were but one danger and to keep him here our certain death therefore it is decreed he dies to night now the good gods forbid that our renowned rome whose gratitude towards her deserved children is enroll'd in jove 's own book like an unnatural dam should now eat up her own he 's a disease that must be cut away o he 's a limb that has but a disease mortal to cut it off to cure it easy what has he done to rome that 's worthy death killing our enemies the blood he hath lost-- which i dare vouch is more than that he hath by many an ounce he dropp'd it for his country and what is left to lose it by his country were to us all that do't and suffer it a brand to the end o the world this is clean kam merely awry when he did love his country it honour'd him the service of the foot being once gangrened is not then respected for what before it was we 'll hear no more pursue him to his house and pluck him thence lest his infection being of catching nature spread further one word more one word this tiger footed rage when it shall find the harm of unscann'd swiftness will too late tie leaden pounds to 's heels proceed by process lest parties as he is beloved break out and sack great rome with romans if it were so,-- what do ye talk have we not had a taste of his obedience our aediles smote ourselves resisted come consider this he has been bred i the wars since he could draw a sword and is ill school'd in bolted language meal and bran together he throws without distinction give me leave i 'll go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form in peace to his utmost peril noble tribunes it is the humane way the other course will prove too bloody and the end of it unknown to the beginning noble menenius be you then as the people 's officer masters lay down your weapons go not home meet on the market place we 'll attend you there where if you bring not marcius we 'll proceed in our first way i 'll bring him to you to the senators let me desire your company he must come or what is worst will follow pray you let 's to him exeunt scene ii a room in coriolanus 's house enter coriolanus with patricians let them puff all about mine ears present me death on the wheel or at wild horses heels or pile ten hills on the tarpeian rock that the precipitation might down stretch below the beam of sight yet will i still be thus to them you do the nobler i muse my mother does not approve me further who was wo nt to call them woollen vassals things created to buy and sell with groats to show bare heads in congregations to yawn be still and wonder when one but of my ordinance stood up to speak of peace or war enter volumnia i talk of you why did you wish me milder would you have me false to my nature rather say i play the man i am o sir sir sir i would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out let go you might have been enough the man you are with striving less to be so lesser had been the thwartings of your dispositions if you had not show'd them how ye were disposed ere they lack'd power to cross you let them hang ay and burn too enter menenius and senators come come you have been too rough something too rough you must return and mend it there 's no remedy unless by not so doing our good city cleave in the midst and perish pray be counsell'd i have a heart as little apt as yours but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage well said noble woman before he should thus stoop to the herd but that the violent fit o the time craves it as physic for the whole state i would put mine armour on which i can scarcely bear what must i do return to the tribunes well what then what then repent what you have spoke for them i can not do it to the gods must i then do't to them you are too absolute though therein you can never be too noble but when extremities speak i have heard you say honour and policy like unsever'd friends i the war do grow together grant that and tell me in peace what each of them by the other lose that they combine not there tush tush a good demand if it be honour in your wars to seem the same you are not which for your best ends you adopt your policy how is it less or worse that it shall hold companionship in peace with honour as in war since that to both it stands in like request why force you this because that now it lies you on to speak to the people not by your own instruction nor by the matter which your heart prompts you but with such words that are but rooted in your tongue though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom 's truth now this no more dishonours you at all than to take in a town with gentle words which else would put you to your fortune and the hazard of much blood i would dissemble with my nature where my fortunes and my friends at stake required i should do so in honour i am in this your wife your son these senators the nobles and you will rather show our general louts how you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard of what that want might ruin noble lady come go with us speak fair you may salve so not what is dangerous present but the loss of what is past i prithee now my son go to them with this bonnet in thy hand and thus far having stretch'd it here be with them-- thy knee bussing the stones for in such business action is eloquence and the eyes of the ignorant more learned than the ears waving thy head which often thus correcting thy stout heart now humble as the ripest mulberry that will not hold the handling or say to them thou art their soldier and being bred in broils hast not the soft way which thou dost confess were fit for thee to use as they to claim in asking their good loves but thou wilt frame thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far as thou hast power and person this but done even as she speaks why their hearts were yours for they have pardons being ask'd as free as words to little purpose prithee now go and be ruled although i know thou hadst rather follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf than flatter him in a bower here is cominius enter cominius i have been i the market place and sir,'tis fit you make strong party or defend yourself by calmness or by absence all 's in anger only fair speech i think twill serve if he can thereto frame his spirit he must and will prithee now say you will and go about it must i go show them my unbarbed sconce must i with base tongue give my noble heart a lie that it must bear well i will do't yet were there but this single plot to lose this mould of marcius they to dust should grind it and throw't against the wind to the market place you have put me now to such a part which never i shall discharge to the life come come we 'll prompt you i prithee now sweet son as thou hast said my praises made thee first a soldier so to have my praise for this perform a part thou hast not done before well i must do't away my disposition and possess me some harlot 's spirit my throat of war be turn'd which quired with my drum into a pipe small as an eunuch or the virgin voice that babies lulls asleep the smiles of knaves tent in my cheeks and schoolboys tears take up the glasses of my sight a beggar 's tongue make motion through my lips and my arm'd knees who bow'd but in my stirrup bend like his that hath received an alms i will not do't lest i surcease to honour mine own truth and by my body 's action teach my mind a most inherent baseness at thy choice then to beg of thee it is my more dishonour than thou of them come all to ruin let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness for i mock at death with as big heart as thou do as thou list thy valiantness was mine thou suck'dst it from me but owe thy pride thyself pray be content mother i am going to the market place chide me no more i 'll mountebank their loves cog their hearts from them and come home beloved of all the trades in rome look i am going commend me to my wife i 'll return consul or never trust to what my tongue can do i the way of flattery further do your will exit away the tribunes do attend you arm yourself to answer mildly for they are prepared with accusations as i hear more strong than are upon you yet the word is mildly pray you let us go let them accuse me by invention i will answer in mine honour ay but mildly well mildly be it then mildly exeunt scene iii the same the forum enter sicinius and brutus in this point charge him home that he affects tyrannical power if he evade us there enforce him with his envy to the people and that the spoil got on the antiates was ne'er distributed enter an aedile what will he come he 's coming how accompanied with old menenius and those senators that always favour'd him have you a catalogue of all the voices that we have procured set down by the poll i have tis ready have you collected them by tribes i have assemble presently the people hither and when they bear me say it shall be so i the right and strength o the commons be it either for death for fine or banishment then let them if i say fine cry fine if death cry death insisting on the old prerogative and power i the truth o the cause i shall inform them and when such time they have begun to cry let them not cease but with a din confused enforce the present execution of what we chance to sentence very well make them be strong and ready for this hint when we shall hap to give t them go about it exit aedile put him to choler straight he hath been used ever to conquer and to have his worth of contradiction being once chafed he can not be rein'd again to temperance then he speaks what 's in his heart and that is there which looks with us to break his neck well here he comes enter coriolanus menenius and cominius with senators and patricians calmly i do beseech you ay as an ostler that for the poorest piece will bear the knave by the volume the honour'd gods keep rome in safety and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men plant love among 's throng our large temples with the shows of peace and not our streets with war amen amen a noble wish re enter aedile with citizens draw near ye people list to your tribunes audience peace i say first hear me speak well say peace ho shall i be charged no further than this present must all determine here i do demand if you submit you to the people 's voices allow their officers and are content to suffer lawful censure for such faults as shall be proved upon you i am content lo citizens he says he is content the warlike service he has done consider think upon the wounds his body bears which show like graves i the holy churchyard scratches with briers scars to move laughter only consider further that when he speaks not like a citizen you find him like a soldier do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds but as i say such as become a soldier rather than envy you well well no more what is the matter that being pass'd for consul with full voice i am so dishonour'd that the very hour you take it off again answer to us say then tis true i ought so we charge you that you have contrived to take from rome all season'd office and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical for which you are a traitor to the people how traitor nay temperately your promise the fires i the lowest hell fold in the people call me their traitor thou injurious tribune within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths in thy hand clutch'd as many millions in thy lying tongue both numbers i would say thou liest unto thee with a voice as free as i do pray the gods mark you this people to the rock to the rock with him peace we need not put new matter to his charge what you have seen him do and heard him speak beating your officers cursing yourselves opposing laws with strokes and here defying those whose great power must try him even this so criminal and in such capital kind deserves the extremest death but since he hath served well for rome,-- what do you prate of service i talk of that that know it you is this the promise that you made your mother know i pray you,-- i know no further let them pronounce the steep tarpeian death vagabond exile raying pent to linger but with a grain a day i would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word nor cheque my courage for what they can give to have't with saying good morrow for that he has as much as in him lies from time to time envied against the people seeking means to pluck away their power as now at last given hostile strokes and that not in the presence of dreaded justice but on the ministers that do distribute it in the name o the people and in the power of us the tribunes we even from this instant banish him our city in peril of precipitation from off the rock tarpeian never more to enter our rome gates i the people 's name i say it shall be so it shall be so it shall be so let him away he 's banish'd and it shall be so hear me my masters and my common friends,-- he 's sentenced no more hearing let me speak i have been consul and can show for rome her enemies marks upon me i do love my country 's good with a respect more tender more holy and profound than mine own life my dear wife 's estimate her womb 's increase and treasure of my loins then if i would speak that,-- we know your drift speak what there 's no more to be said but he is banish'd as enemy to the people and his country it shall be so it shall be so it shall be so you common cry of curs whose breath i hate as reek o the rotten fens whose loves i prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air i banish you and here remain with your uncertainty let every feeble rumour shake your hearts your enemies with nodding of their plumes fan you into despair have the power still to banish your defenders till at length your ignorance which finds not till it feels making not reservation of yourselves still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation that won you without blows despising for you the city thus i turn my back there is a world

pluck from them their tribunes for ever this lies glowing i can tell you and is almost mature for the violent breaking out coriolanus banished banished sir you will be welcome with this intelligence

and seeing me dost not think me for the man i am necessity commands me name myself what is thy name a name unmusical to the volscians ears and harsh in sound to thine say what 's thy name thou hast a grim appearance and thy face bears a command in't though thy tackle 's torn thou show'st a noble vessel what 's thy name prepare thy brow to frown know'st thou me yet i know thee not thy name my name is caius marcius who hath done to thee particularly and to all the volsces great hurt and mischief thereto witness may my surname coriolanus the painful service the extreme dangers and the drops of blood shed for my thankless country are requited but with that surname a good memory and witness of the malice and displeasure which thou shouldst bear me only that name remains the cruelty and envy of the people permitted by our dastard nobles who have all forsook me hath devour'd the rest and suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be whoop'd out of rome now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope-- mistake me not to save my life for if i had fear'd death of all the men i the world i would have voided thee but in mere spite to be full quit of those my banishers stand i before thee here then if thou hast a heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims of shame seen through thy country speed thee straight and make my misery serve thy turn so use it that my revengeful services may prove as benefits to thee for i will fight against my canker'd country with the spleen of all the under fiends but if so be thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes thou'rt tired then in a word i also am longer to live most weary and present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice which not to cut would show thee but a fool since i have ever follow'd thee with hate drawn tuns of blood out of thy country 's breast and can not live but to thy shame unless it be to do thee service o marcius marcius each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy if jupiter should from yond cloud speak divine things and say tis true i'ld not believe them more than thee all noble marcius let me twine mine arms about that body where against my grained ash an hundred times hath broke and scarr'd the moon with splinters here i clip the anvil of my sword and do contest as hotly and as nobly with thy love as ever in ambitious strength i did contend against thy valour know thou first i loved the maid i married never man sigh'd truer breath but that i see thee here thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart than when i first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold why thou mars i tell thee we have a power on foot and i had purpose once more to hew thy target from thy brawn or lose mine arm fort thou hast beat me out twelve several times and i have nightly since dreamt of encounters twixt thyself and me we have been down together in my sleep unbuckling helms fisting each other 's throat and waked half dead with nothing worthy marcius had we no quarrel else to rome but that thou art thence banish'd we would muster all from twelve to seventy and pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful rome like a bold flood o'er bear o come go in and take our friendly senators by the hands who now are here taking their leaves of me who am prepared against your territories though not for rome itself you bless me gods therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges take the one half of my commission and set down-- as best thou art experienced since thou know'st thy country 's strength and weakness,--thine own ways whether to knock against the gates of rome or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them ere destroy but come in let me commend thee first to those that shall say yea to thy desires a thousand welcomes and more a friend than e'er an enemy yet marcius that was much your hand most welcome exeunt coriolanus and aufidius the two servingmen come forward here 's a strange alteration by my hand i had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him what an arm he has he turned me about with his finger and his thumb as one would set up a top nay i knew by his face that there was something in him he had sir a kind of face methought,--i can not tell how to term it he had so looking as it were would i were hanged but i thought there was more in him than i could think so did i i 'll be sworn he is simply the rarest man i the world i think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot on who my master nay it 's no matter for that worth six on him nay not so neither but i take him to be the greater soldier faith look you one can not tell how to say that for the defence of a town our general is excellent ay and for an assault too re enter third servingman o slaves i can tell you news,-- news you rascals what what what let 's partake i would not be a roman of all nations i had as lieve be a condemned man wherefore wherefore why here 's he that was wo nt to thwack our general caius marcius why do you say thwack our general i do not say thwack our general but he was always good enough for him come we are fellows and friends he was ever too hard for him i have heard him say so himself he was too hard for him directly to say the troth on't before corioli he scotched him and notched him like a carbon ado an he had been cannibally given he might have broiled and eaten him too but more of thy news why he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to mars set at upper end o the table no question asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him our general himself makes a mistress of him sanctifies himself with 's hand and turns up the white o the eye to his discourse but the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i the middle and but one half of what he was yesterday for the other has half by the entreaty and grant of the whole table he 'll go he says and sowl the porter of rome gates by the ears he will mow all down before him and leave his passage polled and he 's as like to do't as any man i can imagine do't he will do't for look you sir he has as many friends as enemies which friends sir as it were durst not look you sir show themselves as we term it his friends whilst he 's in directitude directitude what 's that but when they shall see sir his crest up again and the man in blood they will out of their burrows like conies after rain and revel all with him but when goes this forward to morrow to day presently you shall have the drum struck up this afternoon tis as it were a parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they wipe their lips why then we shall have a stirring world again this peace is nothing but to rust iron increase tailors and breed ballad makers let me have war say i it exceeds peace as far as day does night it 's spritely waking audible and full of vent peace is a very apoplexy lethargy mulled deaf sleepy insensible a getter of more bastard children than war 's a destroyer of men tis so and as war in some sort may be said to be a ravisher so it can not be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds ay and it makes men hate one another reason because they then less need one another the wars for my money i hope to see romans as cheap as volscians they are rising they are rising in in in in exeunt scene vi rome a public place enter sicinius and brutus we hear not of him neither need we fear him his remedies are tame i the present peace and quietness of the people which before were in wild hurry here do we make his friends blush that the world goes well who rather had though they themselves did suffer by't behold dissentious numbers pestering streets than see our tradesmen with in their shops and going about their functions friendly we stood to't in good time enter menenius is this menenius tis he,'tis he o he is grown most kind of late hail sir hail to you both your coriolanus is not much miss'd but with his friends the commonwealth doth stand and so would do were he more angry at it all 's well and might have been much better if he could have temporized where is he hear you nay i hear nothing his mother and his wife hear nothing from him enter three or four citizens the gods preserve you both god den our neighbours god den to you all god den to you all ourselves our wives and children on our knees are bound to pray for you both live and thrive farewell kind neighbours we wish'd coriolanus had loved you as we did now the gods keep you farewell farewell exeunt citizens this is a happier and more comely time than when these fellows ran about the streets crying confusion caius marcius was a worthy officer i the war but insolent o'ercome with pride ambitious past all thinking self loving,-- and affecting one sole throne without assistance i think not so we should by this to all our lamentation if he had gone forth consul found it so the gods have well prevented it and rome sits safe and still without him enter an aedile worthy tribunes there is a slave whom we have put in prison reports the volsces with two several powers are enter'd in the roman territories and with the deepest malice of the war destroy what lies before 'em tis aufidius who hearing of our marcius banishment thrusts forth his horns again into the world which were inshell'd when marcius stood for rome and durst not once peep out come what talk you of marcius go see this rumourer whipp'd it can not be the volsces dare break with us can not be we have record that very well it can and three examples of the like have been within my age but reason with the fellow before you punish him where he heard this lest you shall chance to whip your information and beat the messenger who bids beware of what is to be dreaded tell not me i know this can not be not possible enter a messenger the nobles in great earnestness are going all to the senate house some news is come that turns their countenances tis this slave;-- go whip him fore the people 's eyes:--his raising nothing but his report yes worthy sir the slave 's report is seconded and more more fearful is deliver'd what more fearful it is spoke freely out of many mouths-- how probable i do not know that marcius join'd with aufidius leads a power gainst rome and vows revenge as spacious as between the young'st and oldest thing this is most likely raised only that the weaker sort may wish good marcius home again the very trick on't this is unlikely he and aufidius can no more atone than violentest contrariety enter a second messenger you are sent for to the senate a fearful army led by caius marcius associated with aufidius rages upon our territories and have already o'erborne their way consumed with fire and took what lay before them enter cominius o you have made good work what news what news you have holp to ravish your own daughters and to melt the city leads upon your pates to see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,-- what 's the news what 's the news your temples burned in their cement and your franchises whereon you stood confined into an auger 's bore pray now your news you have made fair work i fear me.--pray your news?-- if marcius should be join'd with volscians,-- if he is their god he leads them like a thing made by some other deity than nature that shapes man better and they follow him against us brats with no less confidence than boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies you have made good work you and your apron men you that stood so up much on the voice of occupation and the breath of garlic eaters he will shake your rome about your ears as hercules did shake down mellow fruit you have made fair work but is this true sir ay and you 'll look pale before you find it other all the regions do smilingly revolt and who resist are mock'd for valiant ignorance and perish constant fools who is't can blame him your enemies and his find something in him we are all undone unless the noble man have mercy who shall ask it the tribunes can not do't for shame the people deserve such pity of him as the wolf does of the shepherds for his best friends if they should say be good to rome they charged him even as those should do that had deserved his hate and therein show'd like enemies tis true if he were putting to my house the brand that should consume it i have not the face to say beseech you cease you have made fair hands you and your crafts you have crafted fair you have brought a trembling upon rome such as was never so incapable of help say not we brought it how was it we we loved him but like beasts and cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters who did hoot him out o the city but i fear they 'll roar him in again tullus aufidius the second name of men obeys his points as if he were his officer desperation is all the policy strength and defence that rome can make against them enter a troop of citizens here come the clusters and is aufidius with him you are they that made the air unwholesome when you cast your stinking greasy caps in hooting at coriolanus exile now he 's coming and not a hair upon a soldier 's head which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs as you threw caps up will he tumble down and pay you for your voices tis no matter if he could burn us all into one coal we have deserved it faith we hear fearful news for mine own part when i said banish him i said twas pity and so did i. and so did i and to say the truth so did very many of us that we did we did for the best and though we willingly consented to his banishment yet it was against our will ye re goodly things you voices you have made good work you and your cry shall 's to the capitol o ay what else exeunt cominius and menenius go masters get you home be not dismay'd these are a side that would be glad to have this true which they so seem to fear go home and show no sign of fear the gods be good to us come masters let 's home i ever said we were i the wrong when we banished him so did we all but come let 's home exeunt citizens i do not like this news nor i. let 's to the capitol would half my wealth would buy this for a lie pray let us go exeunt scene vii a camp at a small distance from rome enter aufidius and his lieutenant do they still fly to the roman i do not know what witchcraft 's in him but your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat their talk at table and their thanks at end and you are darken'd in this action sir even by your own i can not help it now unless by using means i lame the foot of our design he bears himself more proudlier even to my person than i thought he would when first i did embrace him yet his nature in that 's no changeling and i must excuse what can not be amended yet i wish sir,-- i mean for your particular,--you had not join'd in commission with him but either had borne the action of yourself or else to him had left it solely i understand thee well and be thou sure when he shall come to his account he knows not what i can urge against him although it seems and so he thinks and is no less apparent to the vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly and shows good husbandry for the volscian state fights dragon like and does achieve as soon as draw his sword yet he hath left undone that which shall break his neck or hazard mine whene'er we come to our account sir i beseech you think you he 'll carry rome all places yield to him ere he sits down and the nobility of rome are his the senators and patricians love him too the tribunes are no soldiers and their people will be as rash in the repeal as hasty to expel him thence i think he 'll be to rome as is the osprey to the fish who takes it by sovereignty of nature first he was a noble servant to them but he could not carry his honours even whether twas pride which out of daily fortune ever taints the happy man whether defect of judgment to fail in the disposing of those chances which he was lord of or whether nature not to be other than one thing not moving from the casque to the cushion but commanding peace even with the same austerity and garb as he controll'd the war but one of these-- as he hath spices of them all not all for i dare so far free him made him fear'd so hated and so banish'd but he has a merit to choke it in the utterance so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time and power unto itself most commendable hath not a tomb so evident as a chair to extol what it hath done one fire drives out one fire one nail one nail rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail come let 's away when caius rome is thine thou art poor'st of all then shortly art thou mine exeunt act v scene i. rome a public place enter menenius cominius sicinius brutus and others no i 'll not go you hear what he hath said which was sometime his general who loved him in a most dear particular he call'd me father but what o that go you that banish'd him a mile before his tent fall down and knee the way into his mercy nay if he coy'd to hear cominius speak i 'll keep at home he would not seem to know me do you hear yet one time he did call me by my name i urged our old acquaintance and the drops that we have bled together coriolanus he would not answer to forbad all names he was a kind of nothing titleless till he had forged himself a name o the fire of burning rome why so you have made good work a pair of tribunes that have rack'd for rome to make coals cheap,--a noble memory i minded him how royal twas to pardon when it was less expected he replied it was a bare petition of a state to one whom they had punish'd very well could he say less i offer'd to awaken his regard for 's private friends his answer to me was he could not stay to pick them in a pile of noisome musty chaff he said twas folly for one poor grain or two to leave unburnt and still to nose the offence for one poor grain or two i am one of those his mother wife his child and this brave fellow too we are the grains you are the musty chaff and you are smelt above the moon we must be burnt for you nay pray be patient if you refuse your aid in this so never needed help yet do not upbraid 's with our distress but sure if you would be your country 's pleader your good tongue more than the instant army we can make might stop our countryman no i 'll not meddle pray you go to him what should i do only make trial what your love can do for rome towards marcius well and say that marcius return me as cominius is return'd unheard what then but as a discontented friend grief shot with his unkindness say't be so yet your good will must have that thanks from rome after the measure as you intended well i 'll undertake t i think he 'll hear me yet to bite his lip and hum at good cominius much unhearts me he was not taken well he had not dined the veins unfill'd our blood is cold and then we pout upon the morning are unapt to give or to forgive but when we have stuff'd these and these conveyances of our blood with wine and feeding we have suppler souls than in our priest like fasts therefore i 'll watch him till he be dieted to my request and then i 'll set upon him you know the very road into his kindness and can not lose your way good faith i 'll prove him speed how it will i shall ere long have knowledge of my success exit he 'll never hear him not i tell you he does sit in gold his eye red as twould burn rome and his injury the gaoler to his pity i kneel'd before him twas very faintly he said rise dismiss'd me thus with his speechless hand what he would do he sent in writing after me what he would not bound with an oath to yield to his conditions so that all hope is vain unless his noble mother and his wife who as i hear mean to solicit him for mercy to his country therefore let 's hence and with our fair entreaties haste them on exeunt scene ii entrance of the volscian camp before rome two sentinels on guard enter to them menenius stay whence are you stand and go back you guard like men tis well but by your leave i am an officer of state and come to speak with coriolanus from whence from rome you may not pass you must return our general will no more hear from thence you 'll see your rome embraced with fire before you 'll speak with coriolanus good my friends if you have heard your general talk of rome and of his friends there it is lots to blanks my name hath touch'd your ears it is menenius be it so go back the virtue of your name is not here passable i tell thee fellow the general is my lover i have been the book of his good acts whence men have read his name unparallel'd haply amplified for i have ever verified my friends of whom he 's chief with all the size that verity would without lapsing suffer nay sometimes like to a bowl upon a subtle ground i have tumbled past the throw and in his praise have almost stamp'd the leasing therefore fellow i must have leave to pass faith sir if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own you should not pass here no though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely therefore go back prithee fellow remember my name is menenius always factionary on the party of your general howsoever you have been his liar as you say you have i am one that telling true under him must say you can not pass therefore go back has he dined canst thou tell for i would not speak with him till after dinner you are a roman are you i am as thy general is then you should hate rome as he does can you when you have pushed out your gates the very defender of them and in a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women the virginal palms of your daughters or with the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as you seem to be can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in with such weak breath as this no you are deceived therefore back to rome and prepare for your execution you are condemned our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon sirrah if thy captain knew i were here he would use me with estimation come my captain knows you not i mean thy general my general cares not for you back i say go lest i let forth your half pint of blood back,--that 's the utmost of your having back nay but fellow fellow,-- enter coriolanus and aufidius what 's the matter now you companion i 'll say an errand for you you shall know now that i am in estimation you shall perceive that a jack guardant can not office me from my son coriolanus guess but by my entertainment with him if thou standest not i the state of hanging or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller in suffering behold now presently and swoon for what 's to come upon thee to coriolanus the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old father menenius does o my son my son thou art preparing fire for us look thee here 's water to quench it i was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee i have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon rome and thy petitionary countrymen the good gods assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here,--this who like a block hath denied my access to thee away how away wife mother child i know not my affairs are servanted to others though i owe my revenge properly my remission lies in volscian breasts that we have been familiar ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather than pity note how much therefore be gone mine ears against your suits are stronger than your gates against my force yet for i loved thee take this along i writ it for thy sake gives a letter and would have rent it another word menenius i will not hear thee speak this man aufidius was my beloved in rome yet thou behold'st you keep a constant temper exeunt coriolanus and aufidius now sir is your name menenius tis a spell you see of much   power you know the way home again do you hear how we are shent for keeping your greatness back what cause do you think i have to swoon i neither care for the world nor your general for such things as you i can scarce think there 's any ye're so slight he that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another let your general do his worst for you be that you are long and your misery increase with your age i say to you as i was said to away exit a noble fellow i warrant him the worthy fellow is our general he 's the rock the oak not to be wind shaken exeunt scene iii the tent of coriolanus enter coriolanus aufidius and others we will before the walls of rome tomorrow set down our host my partner in this action you must report to the volscian lords how plainly i have borne this business only their ends you have respected stopp'd your ears against the general suit of rome never admitted a private whisper no not with such friends that thought them sure of you this last old man whom with a crack'd heart i have sent to rome loved me above the measure of a father nay godded me indeed their latest refuge was to send him for whose old love i have though i show'd sourly to him once more offer'd the first conditions which they did refuse and can not now accept to grace him only that thought he could do more a very little i have yielded to fresh embassies and suits nor from the state nor private friends hereafter will i lend ear to ha what shout is this shout within shall i be tempted to infringe my vow in the same time tis made i will not enter in mourning habits virgilia volumnia leading young marcius valeria and attendants my wife comes foremost then the honour'd mould wherein this trunk was framed and in her hand the grandchild to her blood but out affection all bond and privilege of nature break let it be virtuous to be obstinate what is that curt'sy worth or those doves eyes which can make gods forsworn i melt and am not of stronger earth than others my mother bows as if olympus to a molehill should in supplication nod and my young boy hath an aspect of intercession which great nature cries deny not let the volsces plough rome and harrow italy i 'll never be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand as if a man were author of himself and knew no other kin my lord and husband these eyes are not the same i wore in rome the sorrow that delivers us thus changed makes you think so like a dull actor now i have forgot my part and i am out even to a full disgrace best of my flesh forgive my tyranny but do not say for that forgive our romans o a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss i carried from thee dear and my true lip hath virgin'd it e'er since you gods i prate and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted sink my knee i the earth kneels of thy deep duty more impression show than that of common sons o stand up blest whilst with no softer cushion than the flint i kneel before thee and unproperly show duty as mistaken all this while between the child and parent kneels what is this your knees to me to your corrected son then let the pebbles on the hungry beach fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds strike the proud cedars gainst the fiery sun murdering impossibility to make what can not be slight work thou art my warrior i holp to frame thee do you know this lady the noble sister of publicola the moon of rome chaste as the icicle that 's curdied by the frost from purest snow and hangs on dian 's temple dear valeria this is a poor epitome of yours which by the interpretation of full time may show like all yourself the god of soldiers with the consent of supreme jove inform thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove to shame unvulnerable and stick i the wars like a great sea mark standing every flaw and saving those that eye thee your knee sirrah that 's my brave boy even he your wife this lady and myself are suitors to you i beseech you peace or if you'ld ask remember this before the thing i have forsworn to grant may never be held by you denials do not bid me dismiss my soldiers or capitulate again with rome 's mechanics tell me not wherein i seem unnatural desire not to ally my rages and revenges with your colder reasons o no more no more you have said you will not grant us any thing for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already yet we will ask that if you fail in our request the blame may hang upon your hardness therefore hear us aufidius and you volsces mark for we 'll hear nought from rome in private your request should we be silent and not speak our raiment and state of bodies would bewray what life we have led since thy exile think with thyself how more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither since that thy sight which should make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance with comforts constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow making the mother wife and child to see the son the husband and the father tearing his country 's bowels out and to poor we thine enmity 's most capital thou barr'st us our prayers to the gods which is a comfort that all but we enjoy for how can we alas how can we for our country pray whereto we are bound together with thy victory whereto we are bound alack or we must lose the country our dear nurse or else thy person our comfort in the country we must find an evident calamity though we had our wish which side should win for either thou must as a foreign recreant be led with manacles thorough our streets or else triumphantly tread on thy country 's ruin and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and children 's blood for myself son i purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine if i can not persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread-- trust to't thou shalt not on thy mother 's womb that brought thee to this world ay and mine that brought you forth this boy to keep your name living to time a shall not tread on me i 'll run away till i am bigger but then i 'll fight not of a woman 's tenderness to be requires nor child nor woman 's face to see i have sat too long rising nay go not from us thus if it were so that our request did tend to save the romans thereby to destroy the volsces whom you serve you might condemn us as poisonous of your honour no our suit is that you reconcile them while the volsces may say this mercy we have show'd the romans this we received and each in either side give the all hail to thee and cry be blest for making up this peace thou know'st great son the end of war 's uncertain but this certain that if thou conquer rome the benefit which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses whose chronicle thus writ the man was noble but with his last attempt he wiped it out destroy'd his country and his name remains to the ensuing age abhorr'd speak to me son thou hast affected the fine strains of honour to imitate the graces of the gods to tear with thunder the wide cheeks o the air and yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt that should but rive an oak why dost not speak think'st thou it honourable for a noble man still to remember wrongs daughter speak you he cares not for your weeping speak thou boy perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons there 's no man in the world more bound to 's mother yet here he lets me prate like one i the

your little finger there is some hope the ladies of rome especially his mother may prevail with him but i say there is no hope in't our throats are sentenced and stay upon execution is't possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man there is differency between a grub and a butterfly yet your butterfly was a grub this marcius is grown from man to dragon he has wings he 's more than a creeping thing he loved his mother dearly so did he me and he no more remembers his mother now than an eight year old horse the tartness of his face sours ripe grapes when he walks he moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before his treading he is able to pierce a corslet with his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a battery he sits in his state as a thing made for alexander what he bids be done is finished with his bidding he wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne in yes mercy if you report him truly i paint him in the character mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him there is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger that shall our poor city find and all this is long of you the gods be good unto us no in such a case the gods will not be good unto us when we banished him we respected not them and he returning to break our necks they respect not us enter a messenger sir if you'ld save your life fly to your house the plebeians

aufidius faction most welcome how is it with our general even so as with a man by his own alms empoison'd and with his charity slain most noble sir if you do hold the same intent wherein you wish'd us parties we 'll deliver you of your great danger sir i can not tell we must proceed as we do find the people the people will remain uncertain whilst twixt you there 's difference but the fall of either makes the survivor heir of all i know it and my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction i raised him and i pawn'd mine honour for his truth who being so heighten'd he water'd his new plants with dews of flattery seducing so my friends and to this end he bow'd his nature never known before but to be rough unswayable and free sir his stoutness when he did stand for consul which he lost by lack of stooping,-- that i would have spoke of being banish'd for't he came unto my hearth presented to my knife his throat i took him made him joint servant with me gave him way in all his own desires nay let him choose out of my files his projects to accomplish my best and freshest men served his designments in mine own person holp to reap the fame which he did end all his and took some pride to do myself this wrong till at the last i seem'd his follower not partner and he waged me with his countenance as if i had been mercenary so he did my lord the army marvell'd at it and in the last when he had carried rome and that we look'd for no less spoil than glory,-- there was it for which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him at a few drops of women 's rheum which are as cheap as lies he sold the blood and labour of our great action therefore shall he die and i 'll renew me in his fall but hark drums and trumpets sound with great shouts of the people your native town you enter'd like a post and had no welcomes home but he returns splitting the air with noise and patient fools whose children he hath slain their base throats tear with giving him glory therefore at your vantage ere he express himself or move the people with what he would say let him feel your sword which we will second when he lies along after your way his tale pronounced shall bury his reasons with his body say no more here come the lords enter the lords of the city you are most welcome home i have not deserved it but worthy lords have you with heed perused what i have written to you we have and grieve to hear't what faults he made before the last i think might have found easy fines but there to end where he was to begin and give away the benefit of our levies answering us with our own charge making a treaty where there was a yielding,--this admits no excuse he approaches you shall hear him enter coriolanus marching with drum and colours commoners being with him hail lords i am return'd your soldier no more infected with my country 's love than when i parted hence but still subsisting under your great command you are to know that prosperously i have attempted and with bloody passage led your wars even to the gates of rome our spoils we have brought home do more than counterpoise a full third part the charges of the action we have made peace with no less honour to the antiates

get thee to bed francisco for this relief much thanks tis bitter cold and i am sick at heart have you had quiet guard not a mouse stirring well good night if you do meet horatio and marcellus the rivals of my watch bid them make haste i think i hear them stand ho who 's there enter horatio and marcellus friends to this ground and liegemen to the dane give you good night o farewell honest soldier who hath relieved you bernardo has my place give you good night exit holla bernardo say what is horatio there a piece of him welcome horatio welcome good marcellus what has this thing appear'd again to night i have seen nothing horatio says tis but our fantasy and will not let belief take hold of him touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us therefore i have entreated him along with us to watch the minutes of this night that if again this apparition come he may approve our eyes and speak to it tush tush twill not appear sit down awhile and let us once again assail your ears that are so fortified against our story what we have two nights seen well sit we down and let us hear bernardo speak of this last night of all when yond same star that 's westward from the pole had made his course to illume that part of heaven where now it burns marcellus and myself the bell then beating one,-- enter ghost peace break thee off look where it comes again in the same figure like the king that 's dead thou art a scholar speak to it horatio looks it not like the king   mark it horatio most like it harrows me with fear and wonder it would be spoke to question it horatio what art thou that usurp'st this time of night together with that fair and warlike form in which the majesty of buried denmark did sometimes march by heaven i charge thee speak it is offended see it stalks away stay speak speak i charge thee speak exit ghost tis gone and will not answer how now horatio you tremble and look pale is not this something more than fantasy what think you on't before my god i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes is it not like the king as thou art to thyself such was the very armour he had on when he the ambitious norway combated so frown'd he once when in an angry parle he smote the sledded polacks on the ice tis strange thus twice before and jump at this dead hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state good now sit down and tell me he that knows why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implements of war why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night joint labourer with the day who is't that can inform me that can i at least the whisper goes so our last king whose image even but now appear'd to us was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride dared to the combat in which our valiant hamlet-- for so this side of our known world esteem'd him-- did slay this fortinbras who by a seal'd compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seized of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent was gaged by our king which had return'd to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher as by the same covenant and carriage of the article design'd his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach in't which is no other-- as it doth well appear unto our state-- but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this post haste and romage in the land i think it be no other but e'en so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars a mote it is to trouble the mind 's eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptune 's empire stands was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse and even the like precurse of fierce events as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climatures and countrymen.-- but soft behold lo where it comes again re enter ghost i 'll cross it though it blast me stay illusion if thou hast any sound or use of voice speak to me if there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me cock crows if thou art privy to thy country 's fate which

invulnerable and our vain blows malicious mockery it was about to speak when the cock crew and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air the extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation it faded on the crowing of the cock some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our saviour 's birth is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit dares stir abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallow'd and so gracious is the time so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen to night unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty let 's do't i pray and i this morning know where we shall find him most conveniently exeunt scene ii a room of state in the castle enter king claudius queen gertrude hamlet   polonius laertes voltimand cornelius lords and attendants though yet of hamlet our dear brother 's death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen the imperial jointress to this warlike state have we as twere with a defeated joy,-- with an auspicious and a dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole,-- taken to wife nor have we herein barr'd your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brother 's death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagued with the dream of his advantage he hath not fail'd to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras,-- who impotent and bed rid scarcely hears of this his nephew 's purpose,--to suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltimand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these delated articles allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty in that and all things will we show our duty we doubt it nothing heartily farewell exeunt voltimand and cornelius and now laertes what 's the news with you you told us of some suit what is't laertes you can not speak of reason to the dane and loose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes my dread lord your leave and favour to return to france from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation yet now i must confess that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon have you your father 's leave what says polonius he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition and at last upon his will i seal'd my hard consent i do beseech you give him leave to go take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will but now my cousin hamlet and my son,-- aside   a little more than kin and less than kind how is it that the clouds still hang on you not so my lord i am too much i the sun good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust thou know'st tis common all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity ay madam it is common if it be why seems it so particular with thee seems madam nay it is i know not seems tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black nor windy suspiration of forced breath no nor the fruitful river in the eye nor the dejected havior of the visage together with all forms moods shapes of grief that can denote me truly these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play but i have that within which passeth show these but the trappings and the suits of woe tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persever in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschool'd for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died to day this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg i shall in all my best obey you madam why tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforced accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks to day but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the king 's rouse the heavens all bruit again re speaking earthly thunder come away exeunt all but hamlet o that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew or that the everlasting had not fix'd his canon gainst self slaughter o god god how weary stale flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world fie on't ah fie tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature possess it merely that it should come to this but two months dead nay not so much not two so excellent a king that was to this hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly heaven and earth must i remember why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month-- let me not think on't frailty thy name is woman!-- a little month or ere those shoes were old with which she follow'd my poor father 's body like niobe all tears:--why she even she-- o god a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mourn'd longer married with my uncle my father 's brother but no more like my father than i to hercules within a month ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes she married o most wicked speed to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets it is not nor it can not come to good but break my heart for i must hold my tongue enter horatio marcellus and bernardo hail to your lordship i am glad to see you well horatio,--or i do forget myself the same my lord and your poor servant ever sir my good friend i 'll change that name with you and what make you from wittenberg horatio marcellus my good lord-- i am very glad to see you good even sir but what in faith make you from wittenberg a truant disposition good my lord i would not hear your enemy say so nor shall you do mine ear that violence to make it truster of your own report against yourself i know you are no truant but what is your affair in elsinore we 'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart my lord i came to see your father 's funeral i pray thee do not mock me fellow student i think it was to see my mother 's wedding indeed my lord it follow'd hard upon thrift thrift horatio the funeral baked meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables would i had met my dearest foe in heaven or ever i had seen that day horatio my father!--methinks i see my father where my lord in my mind 's eye horatio i saw him once he was a goodly king he was a man take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again my lord i think i saw him yesternight saw who my lord the king your father the king my father season your admiration for awhile with an attent ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you for god 's love let me hear two nights together had these gentlemen marcellus and bernardo on their watch in the dead vast and middle of the night been thus encounter'd a figure like your father armed at point exactly cap a pe appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them thrice he walk'd by their oppress'd and fear surprised eyes within his truncheon 's length whilst they distilled almost to jelly with the act of fear stand dumb and speak not to him this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had deliver'd both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like but where was this my lord upon the platform where we watch'd did you not speak to it my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up its head and did address itself to motion like as it would speak but even then the morning cock crew loud and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanish'd from our sight tis very strange as i do live my honour'd lord tis true and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me hold you the watch to night we do my lord arm'd say you arm'd my lord from top to toe my lord from head to foot then saw you not his face o yes my lord he wore his beaver up what look'd he frowningly a countenance more in sorrow than in anger pale or red nay very pale and fix'd his eyes upon you most constantly i would i had been there it would have much amazed you very like very like stay'd it long while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred longer longer not when i saw't his beard was grizzled no it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silver'd i will watch to night perchance twill walk again i warrant it will if it assume my noble father 's person i 'll speak to it though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace i pray you all if you have hitherto conceal'd this sight let it be tenable in your silence still and whatsoever else shall hap to night give it an understanding but no tongue i will requite your loves so fare you well upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve i 'll visit you our duty to your honour your loves as mine to you farewell exeunt all but hamlet my father 's spirit in arms all is not well i doubt some foul play would the night were come till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise though all the earth o'erwhelm them to men 's eyes exit scene iii a room in polonius house enter laertes and ophelia my necessaries are embark'd farewell and sister as the winds give benefit and convoy is assistant do not sleep but let me hear from you do you doubt that for hamlet and the trifling of his favour hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of primy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more no more but so think it no more for nature crescent does not grow alone in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear his greatness weigh'd his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not as unvalued persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the safety and health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscribed unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmaster'd importunity fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before their buttons be disclosed and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent be wary then best safety lies in fear youth to itself rebels though none else near i shall the effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart but good my brother do not as some ungracious pastors do show me the steep and thorny way to heaven whiles like a puff'd and reckless libertine himself the primrose path of dalliance treads and recks not his own rede o fear me not i stay too long but here my father comes enter polonius a double blessing is a double grace occasion smiles upon a second leave yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stay'd for there my blessing with thee and these few precepts in thy memory see thou character give thy thoughts no tongue nor any unproportioned thought his act be thou familiar but by no means vulgar those friends thou hast and their adoption tried grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each new hatch'd unfledged comrade beware of entrance to a quarrel but being in bear't that the opposed may beware of thee give every man thy ear but few thy voice take each man 's censure but reserve thy judgment costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not express'd in fancy rich not gaudy for the apparel oft proclaims the man and they in france of the best rank and station are of a most select and generous chief in that neither a borrower nor a lender be for loan oft loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry this above all to thine ownself be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man farewell my blessing season this in thee most humbly do i take my leave my lord the time invites you go your servants tend farewell ophelia and remember well what i have said to you tis in my memory lock'd and you yourself shall keep the key of it farewell exit what is't ophelia be hath said to you so please you something touching the lord hamlet marry well bethought tis told me he hath very oft of late given private time to you and you yourself have of your audience been most free and bounteous if it be so as so tis put on me and that in way of caution i must tell you you do not understand yourself so clearly as it behoves my daughter and your honour what is between you give me up the truth he hath my lord of late made many tenders of his affection to me affection pooh you speak like a green girl unsifted in such perilous circumstance do you believe his tenders as you call them i do not know my lord what i should think marry i 'll teach you think yourself a baby that you have ta'en these tenders for true pay which are not sterling tender yourself more dearly or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase running it thus you'll tender me a fool my lord he hath importuned me with love in honourable fashion ay fashion you may call it go to go to and hath given countenance to his speech my lord with almost all the holy vows of heaven ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know when the blood burns how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter giving more light than heat extinct in both even in their promise as it is a making you must not take for fire from this time be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence set your entreatments at a higher rate than a command to parley for lord hamlet believe so much in him that he is young and with a larger tether may he walk than may be given you in few ophelia do not believe his vows for they are brokers not of that dye which their investments show but mere implorators of unholy suits breathing like sanctified and pious bawds the better to beguile this is for all i would not in plain terms from this time forth have you so slander any moment leisure as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet look to't i charge you come your ways i shall obey my lord exeunt scene iv the platform enter hamlet horatio and marcellus the air bites shrewdly it is very cold it is a nipping and an eager air what hour now i think it lacks of twelve no it is struck indeed i heard it not then it draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wo nt to walk a flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within what does this mean my lord the king doth wake to night and takes his rouse keeps wassail and the swaggering up spring reels and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down the kettle drum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge is it a custom ay marry is't but to my mind though i am native here and to the manner born it is a custom more honour'd in the breach than the observance this heavy headed revel east and west makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase soil our addition and indeed it takes from our achievements though perform'd at height the pith and marrow of our attribute so oft it chances in particular men that for some vicious mole of nature in them as in their birth wherein they are not guilty since nature can not choose his origin-- by the o'ergrowth of some complexion oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason or by some habit that too much o'er leavens the form of plausive manners that these men carrying i say the stamp of one defect being nature 's livery or fortune 's star,-- their virtues else be they as pure as grace as infinite as man may undergo-- shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault the dram of eale doth all the noble substance of a doubt to his own scandal look my lord it comes enter ghost angels and ministers of grace defend us be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell be thy intents wicked or charitable thou comest in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee i 'll call thee hamlet king father royal dane o answer me let me not burst in ignorance but tell why thy canonized bones hearsed in death have burst their cerements why the sepulchre wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again what may this mean that thou dead corse again in complete steel revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon making night hideous and we fools of nature so horridly to shake our disposition with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls say why is this wherefore what should we do ghost beckons hamlet it beckons you to go away with it as if it some impartment did desire to you alone look with what courteous action it waves you to a more removed ground but do not go with it no by no means it will not speak then i will follow it do not my lord why what should be the fear i do not set my life in a pin 's fee and for my soul what can it do to that being a thing immortal as itself it waves me forth again i 'll follow it what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that beetles o'er his base into the sea and there assume some other horrible form which might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness think of it the very place puts toys of desperation without more motive into every brain that looks so many fathoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath it waves me still go on i 'll follow thee you shall not go my lord hold off your hands be ruled you shall not go my fate cries out and makes each petty artery in this body as hardy as the nemean lion 's nerve still am i call'd unhand me gentlemen by heaven i 'll make a ghost of him that lets me i say away go on i 'll follow thee exeunt ghost and hamlet he waxes desperate with imagination let 's follow tis not fit thus to obey him have after to what issue will this come something is rotten in the state of denmark heaven will direct it nay let 's follow him exeunt scene v. another part of the platform enter ghost and hamlet where wilt thou lead me speak i 'll go no further mark me i will my hour is almost come when i to sulphurous and tormenting flames must render up myself alas poor ghost pity me not but lend thy serious hearing to what i shall unfold speak i am bound to hear so art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear what i am thy father 's spirit doom'd for a certain term to walk the night and for the day confined to fast in fires till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purged away but that i am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house i could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres thy knotted and combined locks to part and each particular hair to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porpentine but this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood list list o list if thou didst ever thy dear father love-- o god revenge his foul and most unnatural murder murder murder most foul as in the best it is but this most foul strange and unnatural haste me to know't that i with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love may sweep to my revenge i find thee apt and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed that roots itself in ease on lethe wharf wouldst thou not stir in this now hamlet hear tis given out that sleeping in my orchard a serpent stung me so the whole ear of denmark is by a forged process of my death rankly abused but know thou noble youth the serpent that did sting thy father 's life now wears his crown o my prophetic soul my uncle ay that incestuous that adulterate beast with witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts,-- o wicked wit and gifts that have the power so to seduce!--won to his shameful lust the will of my most seeming virtuous queen o hamlet what a falling off was there from me whose love was of that dignity that it went hand in hand even with the vow i made to her in marriage and to decline upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor to those of mine but virtue as it never will be moved though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven so lust though to a radiant angel link'd will sate itself in a celestial bed and prey on garbage but soft methinks i scent the morning air brief let me be sleeping within my orchard my custom always of the afternoon upon my secure hour thy uncle stole with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial and in the porches of my ears did pour the leperous distilment whose effect holds such an enmity with blood of man that swift as quicksilver it courses through the natural gates and alleys of the body and with a sudden vigour doth posset and curd like eager droppings into milk the thin and wholesome blood so did it mine and a most instant tetter bark'd about most lazar like with vile and loathsome crust all my smooth body thus was i sleeping by a brother 's hand of life of crown of queen at once dispatch'd cut off even in the blossoms of my sin unhousel'd disappointed unanel'd no reckoning made but sent to my account with all my imperfections on my head o horrible o horrible most horrible if thou hast nature in thee bear it not let not the royal bed of denmark be a couch for luxury and damned incest but howsoever thou pursuest this act taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive against thy mother aught leave her to heaven and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge to prick and sting her fare

before you visit him to make inquire of his behavior my lord i did intend it marry well said very well said look you sir inquire me first what danskers are in paris and how and who what means and where they keep what company at what expense and finding by this encompassment and drift of question that they do know my son come you more nearer than your particular demands will touch it take you as twere some distant knowledge of him as thus i know his father and his friends and in part him do you mark this reynaldo ay very well my lord and in part him but you may say not well but if't be he i mean he 's very wild addicted so and so and there put on him what forgeries you please marry none so rank as may dishonour him take heed of that but sir such wanton wild and usual slips as are companions noted and most known to youth and liberty as gaming my lord ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling drabbing you may go so far my lord that would dishonour him faith no as you may season it in the charge you must not put another scandal on him that he is open to incontinency that 's not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly that they may seem the taints of liberty the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind a savageness in unreclaimed blood of general assault but my good lord,-- wherefore should you do this ay my lord i would know that marry sir here 's my drift and i believe it is a fetch of wit you laying these slight sullies on my son as twere a thing a little soil'd i the working mark you your party in converse him you would sound having ever seen in the prenominate crimes the youth you breathe of guilty be assured he closes with you in this consequence good sir or so or friend or gentleman according to the phrase or the addition of man and country very good my lord and then sir does he this he does what was i about to say by the mass i was about to say something where did i leave at closes in the consequence at friend or so and gentleman at closes in the consequence ay marry he closes thus i know the gentleman i saw him yesterday or t other day or then or then with such or such and as you say there was a gaming there o'ertook in 's rouse there falling out at tennis or perchance i saw him enter such a house of sale videlicet a brothel or so forth see you now your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth and thus do we of wisdom and of reach with windlasses and with assays of bias by indirections find directions out so by my former lecture and advice shall you my son you have me have you not my lord i have god be wi you fare you well good my lord observe his inclination in yourself i shall my lord and let him ply his music well my lord farewell exit reynaldo enter ophelia how now ophelia what 's the matter o my lord my lord i have been so affrighted with what i the name of god my lord as i was sewing in my closet lord hamlet with his doublet all unbraced no hat upon his head his stockings foul'd ungarter'd and down gyved to his ancle pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors,--he comes before me mad for thy love my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it what said he he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus o'er his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stay'd he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he raised a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turn'd he seem'd to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their helps and to the last bended their light on me come go with me i will go seek the king this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passion under heaven that does afflict our natures i am sorry what have you given him any hard words of late no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his fetters and denied his access to me that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him i fear'd he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy by heaven it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion come go we to the king this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love exeunt scene ii a room in the castle enter king claudius queen gertrude rosencrantz guildenstern and attendants welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending something have you heard of hamlet 's transformation so call it sith nor the exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was what it should be more than his father 's death that thus hath put him so much from the understanding of himself i can not dream of i entreat you both that being of so young days brought up with him and sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that open'd lies within our remedy good gentlemen he hath much talk'd of you and sure i am two men there are not living to whom he more adheres if it will please you to show us so much gentry and good will as to expend your time with us awhile for the supply and profit of our hope your visitation shall receive such thanks as fits a king 's remembrance both your majesties might by the sovereign power you have of us put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty but we both obey and here give up ourselves in the full bent to lay our service freely at your feet to be commanded thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern thanks guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changed son go some of you and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is heavens make our presence and our practises pleasant and helpful to him ay amen exeunt rosencrantz guildenstern and some attendants enter polonius the ambassadors from norway my good lord are joyfully return'd thou still hast been the father of good news have i my lord i assure my good liege i hold my duty as i hold my soul both to my god and to my gracious king and i do think or else this brain of mine hunts not the trail of policy so sure as it hath used to do that i have found the very cause of hamlet 's lunacy o speak of that that do i long to hear give first admittance to the ambassadors my news shall be the fruit to that great feast thyself do grace to them and bring them in exit polonius he tells me my dear gertrude he hath found the head and source of all your son 's distemper i doubt it is no other but the main his father 's death and our o'erhasty marriage well we shall sift him re enter polonius with voltimand and cornelius welcome my good friends say voltimand what from our brother norway most fair return of greetings and desires upon our first he sent out to suppress his nephew 's levies which to him appear'd to be a preparation gainst the polack but better look'd into he truly found it was against your highness whereat grieved that so his sickness age and impotence was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests on fortinbras which he in brief obeys receives rebuke from norway and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give the assay of arms against your majesty whereon old norway overcome with joy gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee and his commission to employ those soldiers so levied as before against the polack with an entreaty herein further shown giving a paper that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise on such regards of safety and allowance as therein are set down it likes us well and at our more consider'd time well read answer and think upon this business meantime we thank you for your well took labour go to your rest at night we 'll feast together most welcome home exeunt voltimand and cornelius this business is well ended my liege and madam to expostulate what majesty should be what duty is why day is day night night and time is time were nothing but to waste night day and time therefore since brevity is the soul of wit and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes i will be brief your noble son is mad mad call i it for to define true madness what is't but to be nothing else but mad but let that go more matter with less art madam i swear i use no art at all that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity and pity tis tis true a foolish figure but farewell it for i will use no art mad let us grant him then and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect or rather say the cause of this defect for this effect defective comes by cause thus it remains and the remainder thus perpend i have a daughter have while she is mine-- who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this now gather and surmise reads to the celestial and my soul 's idol the most beautified ophelia,'-- that 's an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is a vile phrase but you shall hear thus reads in her excellent white bosom these   and c. came this from hamlet to her good madam stay awhile i will be faithful reads doubt thou the stars are fire doubt that the sun doth move doubt truth to be a liar but never doubt i love o dear ophelia i am ill at these numbers i have not art to reckon my groans but that i love thee best o most best believe it adieu thine evermore most dear lady whilst this machine is to him hamlet this in obedience hath my daughter shown me and more above hath his solicitings as they fell out by time by means and place all given to mine ear but how hath she received his love what do you think of me as of a man faithful and honourable i would fain prove so but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing-- as i perceived it i must tell you that before my daughter told me what might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had play'd the desk or table book or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or look'd upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i precepts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repulsed a short tale to make-- fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we mourn for do you think tis this it may be very likely hath there been such a time i'd fain know that-- that i have positively said tis so when it proved otherwise not that i know pointing to his head and shoulder take this from this if this be otherwise if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the centre how may we try it further you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby so he does indeed at such a time i 'll loose my daughter to him be you and i behind an arras then mark the encounter if he love her not and be not from his reason fall'n thereon let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and carters we will try it but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading away i do beseech you both away i 'll board him presently exeunt king claudius queen gertrude and attendants enter hamlet reading o give me leave how does my good lord hamlet well god a mercy do you know me my lord excellent well you are a fishmonger not i my lord then i would you were so honest a man honest my lord ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand that 's very true my lord for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a god kissing carrion,--have you a daughter i have my lord let her not walk i the sun conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive friend look to t. aside   how say you by that still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love very near this i 'll speak to him again what do you read my lord words words words what is the matter my lord between who i mean the matter that you read my lord slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab you could go backward aside   though this be madness yet there is method in t. will you walk out of the air my lord into my grave indeed that is out o the air aside how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter.--my honourable lord i will most humbly take my leave of you you can not sir take from me any thing that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life fare you well my lord these tedious old fools enter rosencrantz and guildenstern you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is to polonius   god save you sir exit polonius my honoured lord my most dear lord my excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do ye both as the indifferent children of the earth happy in that we are not over happy on fortune 's cap we are not the very button nor the soles of her shoe neither my lord then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours faith her privates we in the secret parts of fortune o most true she is a strumpet what 's the news none my lord but that the world 's grown honest then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither prison my lord denmark 's a prison then is the world one a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o the worst we think not so my lord why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind o god i could be bounded in a nut shell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream a dream itself is but a shadow truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow 's shadow then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars shadows shall we to the court for by my fay i can not reason we 'll wait upon you no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore to visit you my lord no other occasion beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come deal justly with me come come nay speak what should we say my lord why any thing but to the purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen have sent for you to what end my lord that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no aside to guildenstern   what say you aside   nay then i have an eye of you.--if you love me hold not off my lord we were sent for i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o'erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in faculty in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humourous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled o the sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for't what players are they even those you were wo nt to take delight in the tragedians of the city how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed no indeed are they not how comes it do they grow rusty nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an aery of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for't these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither what are they children who maintains 'em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question is't possible o there has been much throwing about of brains do the boys carry it away ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too it is not very strange for mine uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mows at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty an hundred ducats a piece for his picture in little sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out flourish of trumpets within there are the players gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come then the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than yours you are welcome but my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived in what my dear lord i am but mad north north west when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw enter polonius well be with you gentlemen hark you guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts happily he 's the second time come to them for they say an old man is twice a child i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players mark it you say right sir o monday morning twas so indeed my lord i have news to tell you my lord i have news to tell you when roscius was an actor in rome,-- the actors are come hither my lord buz buz upon mine honour,-- then came each actor on his ass,-- the best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy history pastoral pastoral comical historical pastoral tragical historical tragical- comical historical pastoral scene individable or poem unlimited seneca can not be too heavy nor plautus too light for the law of writ and the liberty these are the only men o jephthah judge of israel what a treasure hadst thou what a treasure had he my lord why one fair daughter and no more the which he loved passing well aside   still on my daughter am i not i the right old jephthah if you call me jephthah my lord i have a daughter that i love passing well nay that follows not what follows then my lord why as by lot god wot and then you know it came to pass as most like it was,'-- the first row of the pious chanson will show you more for look where my abridgement comes enter four or five players you are welcome masters welcome all i am glad to see thee well welcome good friends o my old friend thy face is valenced since i saw thee last comest thou to beard me in denmark what my young lady and mistress by'r lady your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when i saw you last by the altitude of a chopine pray god your voice like apiece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the ring masters you are all welcome we 'll e'en to't like french falconers fly at any thing we see we 'll have a speech straight come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech what speech my lord i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million twas caviare to the general but it was as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in it i chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priam 's slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see-- the rugged pyrrhus like the hyrcanian beast,'-- it is not so:--it begins with pyrrhus:-- the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly trick'd with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons baked and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and damned light to their lord 's murder roasted in wrath and fire and thus o'er sized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion anon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command unequal match'd pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword the unnerved father falls then senseless ilium seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seem'd i the air to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause aroused vengeance sets him new a work and never did the cyclops hammers fall on mars 's armour forged for proof eterne with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword now falls on priam out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods in general synod take away her power break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven as low as to the fiends this is too long it shall to the barber 's with your beard prithee say on he 's for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps say on come to hecuba but who o who had seen the mobled queen-- the mobled queen that 's good mobled queen is good run barefoot up and down threatening the flames with bisson rheum a clout upon that head where late the diadem stood and for a robe about her lank and all o'er teemed loins a blanket in the alarm of fear caught up who this had seen with tongue in venom steep'd gainst fortune 's state would treason have pronounced but if the gods themselves did see her then when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport in mincing with his sword her husband 's limbs the instant burst of clamour that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods look whether he has not turned his colour and has tears in 's eyes pray you no more tis well i 'll have thee speak out the rest soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live my lord i will use them according to their desert god 's bodykins man much better use every man after his desert and who should scape whipping use them after your own honour and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them in come sirs follow him friends we 'll hear a play to morrow exit polonius with all the players but the first dost thou hear me old friend can you play the murder of gonzago ay my lord we 'll ha't to morrow night you could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which i would set down and insert in't could you not ay my lord very well follow that lord and look you mock him not exit first player my good friends i 'll leave you till night you are welcome to elsinore good my lord ay so god be wi ye exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern now i am alone o what a rogue and peasant slave am i is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wann'd tears in his eyes distraction in 's aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba what 's hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appal the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i a dull and muddy mettled rascal peak like john a dreams unpregnant of my cause and can say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most dear life a damn'd defeat was made am i a coward who calls me villain breaks my pate across plucks off my beard and blows it in my face tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i the throat as deep as to the lungs who does me this ha swounds i should take it for it can not be but i am pigeon liver'd and lack gall to make oppression bitter or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slave 's offal bloody bawdy villain remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain o vengeance why what an ass am i this is most brave that i the son of a dear father murder'd prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall a cursing like a very drab a scullion fie upon't foh about my brain i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaim'd their malefactions for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ i 'll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle i 'll observe his looks i 'll tent him to the quick if he but blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be the devil and the devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me i 'll have grounds more relative than this the play 's the thing wherein i 'll catch the conscience of the king exit act iii scene i. a room in the castle enter king claudius queen gertrude polonius ophelia rosencrantz and guildenstern and can you by no drift of circumstance get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy he does confess he feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak nor do we find him forward to be sounded but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state did he receive you well most like a gentleman but with much forcing of his disposition niggard of question but of our demands most free in his reply did you assay him to any pastime madam it so fell out that certain players we o'er raught on the way of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are about the court and as i think they have already order this night to play before him tis most true and he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclined good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights we shall my lord exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behaved if t be the affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for i shall obey you and for your part ophelia i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlet 's wildness so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted way again to both your honours madam i wish it may exit queen gertrude ophelia walk you here gracious so please you we will bestow ourselves to ophelia read on this book that show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness we are oft to blame in this,-- tis too much proved that with devotion 's visage and pious action we do sugar o'er the devil himself aside           o tis too true how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience the harlot 's cheek beautied with plastering art is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word o heavy burthen i hear him coming let 's withdraw my lord exeunt king claudius and polonius enter hamlet to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heart ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummation devoutly to be wish'd to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay there 's the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause there 's the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressor 's wrong the proud man 's contumely the pangs of despised love the law 's delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscover'd country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action.--soft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons be all my sins remember'd good my lord how does your honour for this many a day i humbly thank you well well well my lord i have remembrances of yours that i have longed long to re deliver i pray you now receive them no not i i never gave you aught my honour'd lord you know right well you did and with them words of so sweet breath composed as made the things more rich their perfume lost take these again for to the noble mind rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind there my lord ha ha are you honest my lord are you fair what means your lordship that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love you once indeed my lord you made me believe so you should not have believed me for virtue can not so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not i was the more deceived get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery where 's your father at home my lord let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool no where but in 's own house farewell o help him you sweet heavens if thou dost marry i 'll give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny get thee to a nunnery go farewell or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them to a nunnery go and quickly too

creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance go to i 'll no more on't it hath made me mad i say we will have no more marriages those that are married already all but one shall live the rest shall keep as they are to a nunnery go exit o what a noble mind is here o'erthrown the courtier 's soldier 's scholar 's eye tongue sword the expectancy and rose of the fair state the glass of fashion and the mould of form the observed of all observers quite quite down and i of ladies most deject and wretched that suck'd the honey of his music vows now see that noble and most sovereign reason like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh that unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth blasted with ecstasy o woe is me to have seen what i have seen see what i see re enter king claudius and polonius love his affections do not that way tend nor what he spake though it lack'd form a little was not like madness there 's something in his soul o'er which his melancholy sits on brood and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this something settled matter in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself what think you on't it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love how now ophelia you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief let her be round with him and i 'll be placed so please you in the ear of all their conference if she find him not to england send him or confine him where your wisdom best shall think it shall be so madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go exeunt scene ii a hall in the castle enter hamlet and players speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of your players do i had as lief the town crier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say the whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumbshows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing termagant it out herods herod pray you avoid it i warrant your honour be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special o'erstep not the modesty of nature for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh can not but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature 's journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably i hope we have reformed that indifferently with us sir o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered that 's villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go make you ready exeunt players enter

mildew'd ear blasting his wholesome brother have you eyes could you on this fair mountain leave to feed and batten on this moor ha have you eyes you can not call it love for at your age the hey day in the blood is tame it 's humble and waits upon the judgment and what judgment would step from this to this sense sure you have else could you not have motion but sure that sense is apoplex'd for madness would not err nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd but it reserved some quantity of choice to serve in such a difference what devil was't that thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman blind eyes without feeling feeling without sight ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all or but a sickly part of one true sense could not so mope o shame where is thy blush rebellious hell if thou canst mutine in a matron 's bones to flaming youth let virtue be as wax and melt in her own fire proclaim no shame when the compulsive ardour gives the charge since frost itself as actively doth burn and reason panders will o hamlet speak no more thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul and there i see such black and grained spots as will not leave their tinct nay but to live in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed stew'd in corruption honeying and making love over the nasty sty,-- o speak to me no more these words like daggers enter in mine ears no more sweet hamlet a murderer and a villain a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe of your precedent lord a vice of kings a cutpurse of the empire and the rule that from a shelf the precious diadem stole and put it in his pocket no more a king of

between her and her fighting soul conceit in weakest bodies strongest works speak to her hamlet how is it with you lady alas how is't with you that you do bend your eye on vacancy and with the incorporal air do hold discourse forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep and as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm your bedded hair like life in excrements starts up and stands on end o gentle son upon the heat and flame of thy distemper sprinkle cool patience whereon do you look on him on him look you how pale he glares his form and cause conjoin'd preaching to stones would make them capable do not look upon me lest with this piteous action you convert my stern effects then what i have to do will want true colour tears perchance for blood to whom do you speak this do you see nothing there nothing at all yet all that is i see nor did you nothing hear no nothing but ourselves why look you there look how it steals away my father in his habit as he lived look where he goes even now out at the portal exit ghost this the very coinage of your brain this bodiless creation ecstasy is very cunning in ecstasy my pulse as yours doth temperately keep time and makes as healthful music it is not madness that i have utter'd bring me to the test and i the matter will re word which madness would gambol from mother for love of grace lay not that mattering unction to your soul that not your trespass but my madness speaks it will but skin and film the ulcerous place whilst rank corruption mining all within infects unseen confess yourself to heaven repent what 's past avoid what is to come

another room in the castle enter king claudius and laertes now must your conscience my acquaintance seal and you must put me in your heart for friend sith you have heard and with a knowing ear that he which hath your noble father slain pursued my life it well appears but tell me why you proceeded not against these feats so crimeful and so capital in nature as by your safety wisdom all things else you mainly were stirr'd up o for two special reasons which may to you perhaps seem much unsinew'd but yet to me they are strong the queen his mother lives almost by his looks and for myself-- my virtue or my plague be it either which-- she 's so conjunctive to my life and soul that as the star moves not but in his sphere i could not but by her the other motive why to a public count i might not go is the great love the general gender bear him who dipping all his faults in their affection would like the spring that turneth wood to stone convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind would have reverted to my bow again and not where i had aim'd them and so have i a noble father lost a sister driven into desperate terms whose worth if praises may go back again stood challenger on mount of all the age for her perfections but my revenge will come break not your sleeps for that you must not think that we are made of stuff so flat and dull that we can let our beard be shook with danger and think it pastime you shortly shall hear more i loved your father and we love ourself and that i hope will teach you to imagine-- enter a messenger how now what news letters my lord from hamlet this to your majesty this to the queen from hamlet who brought them sailors my lord they say i saw them not they were given me by claudio he received them of him that brought them laertes you shall hear them leave us exit messenger reads high and mighty you shall know i am set naked on your kingdom to morrow shall i beg leave to see your kingly eyes when i shall first asking your pardon thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return                   hamlet what should this mean are all the rest come back or is it some abuse and no such thing know you the hand tis hamlets character naked and in a postscript here he says alone can you advise me i 'm lost in it my lord but let him come it warms the very sickness in my heart that i shall live and tell him to his teeth thus didest thou if it be so laertes-- as how should it be so how otherwise?-- will you be ruled by me ay my lord so you will not o'errule me to a peace to thine own peace if he be now return'd as checking at his voyage and that he means no more to undertake it i will work him to an exploit now ripe in my device under the which he shall not choose but fall and for his death no wind of blame shall breathe but even his mother shall uncharge the practise and call it accident my lord i will be ruled the rather if you could devise it so that i might be the organ it falls right you have been talk'd of since your travel much and that in hamlet 's hearing for a quality wherein they say you shine your sum of parts did not together pluck such envy from him as did that one and that in my regard of the unworthiest siege what part is that my lord a very riband in the cap of youth yet needful too for youth no less becomes the light and careless livery that it wears than settled age his sables and his weeds importing health and graveness two months since here was a gentleman of normandy:-- i 've seen myself and served against the french and they can well on horseback but this gallant had witchcraft in't he grew unto his seat and to such wondrous doing brought his horse as he had been incorpsed and demi natured with the brave beast so far he topp'd my thought that i in forgery of shapes and tricks come short of what he did a norman was't a norman upon my life lamond the very same i know him well he is the brooch indeed and gem of all the nation he made confession of you and gave you such a masterly report for art and exercise in your defence and for your rapier most especially that he cried out twould be a sight indeed if one could match you the scrimers of their nation he swore had had neither motion guard nor eye if you opposed them sir this report of his did hamlet so envenom with his envy that he could nothing do but wish and beg your sudden coming o'er to play with him now out of this,-- what out of this my lord laertes was your father dear to you or are you like the painting of a sorrow a face without a heart why ask you this not that i think you did not love your father but that i know love is begun by time and that i see in passages of proof time qualifies the spark and fire of it there lives within the very flame of love a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it and nothing is at a like goodness still for goodness growing to a plurisy dies in his own too much that we would do we should do when we would for this would changes and hath abatements and delays as many as there are tongues are hands are accidents and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh that hurts by easing but to the quick o the ulcer:-- hamlet comes back what would you undertake to show yourself your father 's son in deed more than in words to cut his throat i the church no place indeed should murder sanctuarize revenge should have no bounds but good laertes will you do this keep close within your chamber hamlet return'd shall know you are come home we 'll put on those shall praise your excellence and set a double varnish on the fame the frenchman gave you bring you in fine together and wager on your heads he being remiss most generous and free from all contriving will not peruse the foils so that with ease or with a little shuffling you may choose a sword unbated and in a pass of practise requite him for your father i will do't and for that purpose i 'll anoint my sword i bought an unction of a mountebank so mortal that but dip a knife in it where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare collected from all simples that have virtue under the moon can save the thing from death that is but scratch'd withal i 'll touch my point with this contagion that if i gall him slightly it may be death let 's further think of this weigh what convenience both of time and means may fit us to our shape if this should fail and that our drift look through our bad performance twere better not assay'd therefore this project should have a back or second that might hold if this should blast in proof soft let me see we 'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings i ha't when in your motion you are hot and dry-- as make your bouts more violent to that end-- and that he calls for drink i 'll have prepared him a chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping if he by chance escape your venom'd stuck our purpose may hold there enter queen gertrude how now sweet queen one woe doth tread upon another 's heel so fast they follow your sister 's drown'd laertes drown'd o where there is a willow grows aslant a brook that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream there with fantastic garlands did she come of crow flowers nettles daisies and long purples that liberal shepherds give a grosser name but our cold maids do dead men 's fingers call them there on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds clambering to hang an envious sliver broke when down her weedy trophies and herself fell in the weeping brook her clothes spread wide and mermaid like awhile they bore her up which time she chanted snatches of old tunes as one incapable of her own distress or like a creature native and indued unto that element but long it could not be till that her garments heavy with their drink pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay to muddy death alas then she is drown'd drown'd drown'd too much of water hast thou poor ophelia and therefore i forbid my tears but yet it is our trick nature her custom holds let shame say what it will when these are gone the woman will be out adieu my lord i have a speech of fire that fain would blaze but that this folly douts it exit let 's follow gertrude how much i had to do to calm his rage now fear i this will give it start again therefore let 's follow exeunt act v scene i. a churchyard enter two clowns with spades   and c is she to be buried in christian burial that wilfully seeks her own salvation i tell thee she is and therefore make her grave straight the crowner hath sat on her and finds it christian burial how can that be unless she drowned herself in her own defence why tis found so it must be se offendendo it can not be else for here lies the point   if i drown myself wittingly it argues an act and an act hath three branches it is to act to do to perform argal she drowned herself wittingly nay but hear you goodman delver,-- give me leave here lies the water good here stands the man good if the man go to this water and drown himself it is will he nill he he goes,--mark you that but if the water come to him and drown him he drowns not himself argal he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life but is this law ay marry is't crowner 's quest law will you ha the truth on't if this had not been a gentlewoman she should have been buried out o christian burial why there thou say'st and the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even christian come my spade there is no ancient gentleman but gardeners ditchers and grave makers they hold up adam 's profession was he a gentleman he was the first that ever bore arms why he had none what art a heathen how dost thou understand the scripture the scripture says adam digged could he dig without arms i 'll put another question to thee if thou answerest me not to the purpose confess thyself-- go to what is he that builds stronger than either the mason the shipwright or the carpenter the gallows maker for that frame outlives a thousand tenants i like thy wit well in good faith the gallows does well but how does it well it does well to those that do in now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built

knave is we must speak by the card or equivocation will undo us by the lord horatio these three years i have taken a note of it the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he gaffs his kibe how long hast thou been a grave maker of all the days i the year i came to't that day that our last king hamlet overcame fortinbras how long is that since can not you tell that every fool can tell that it was the very day that young hamlet was born he that is mad and sent into england ay marry why was he sent into england why because he was mad he shall recover his wits there or if he do not it 's no great matter there why twill a not be seen in him there there the men are as mad as he how came he mad very strangely they say how strangely faith e'en

come make her laugh at that prithee horatio tell me one thing what 's that my lord dost thou think alexander looked o this fashion i the earth e'en so and smelt so pah puts down the skull e'en so my lord to what base uses we may return horatio why may not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander till he find it stopping a bung hole twere to consider too curiously to consider so no faith not a jot but to follow him thither with modesty enough and likelihood to lead it as thus alexander died alexander was buried alexander returneth into dust the dust is earth of earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer barrel imperious caesar dead and turn'd to clay might stop a hole to keep the wind away o that that earth which kept the world in awe should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw but soft but soft aside here comes the king enter priest   and c. in procession the corpse of   ophelia laertes and mourners following king claudius queen gertrude their trains   and c the queen the courtiers who is this they follow and with such maimed rites this doth betoken the corse they follow did with desperate hand fordo its own life twas of some estate couch we awhile and mark retiring with horatio what ceremony else that is laertes a very noble youth mark what ceremony else her obsequies have been as far enlarged as we have warrantise her death was doubtful and but that great command o'ersways the order she should in ground unsanctified have lodged till the last trumpet for charitable prayers shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants her maiden strewments and the bringing home of bell and burial must there no more be done no more be done we should profane the service of the dead to sing a requiem and such rest to her as to peace parted souls lay her i the earth and from her fair and unpolluted flesh may violets spring i tell thee churlish priest a ministering angel shall my sister be when thou liest howling what the fair ophelia sweets to the sweet farewell scattering flowers i hoped thou shouldst have been my hamlet 's wife i thought thy bride bed to have deck'd sweet maid and not have strew'd thy grave o treble woe fall ten times treble on that cursed head whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense deprived thee of hold off the earth awhile till i have caught her once more in mine arms leaps into the grave now pile your dust upon the quick and dead till of this flat a mountain you have made to o'ertop old pelion or the skyish head of blue olympus advancing      what is he whose grief bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow conjures the wandering stars and makes them stand like wonder wounded hearers this is i hamlet the dane leaps into the grave the devil take thy soul grappling with him thou pray'st not well i prithee take thy fingers from my throat for though i am not splenitive and rash yet have i something in me dangerous which let thy wiseness fear hold off thy hand pluck them asunder hamlet hamlet gentlemen,-- good my lord be quiet the attendants part them and they come out of the grave why i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer wag o my son what theme i loved ophelia forty thousand brothers could not with all their quantity of love make up my sum what wilt thou do for her o he is mad laertes for love of god forbear him swounds show me what thou'lt do woo't weep woo't fight woo't fast woo't tear thyself woo't drink up eisel eat a crocodile i 'll do't dost thou come here to whine to outface me with leaping in her grave be buried quick with her and so will i and if thou prate of mountains let them throw millions of acres on us till our ground singeing his pate against the burning zone make ossa like a wart nay an thou'lt mouth i 'll rant as well as thou this is mere madness and thus awhile the fit will work on him anon as patient as the female dove when that her golden couplets are disclosed his silence will sit drooping hear you sir what is the reason that you use me thus i loved you ever but it is no matter let hercules himself do what he may the cat will mew and dog will have his day exit i pray you good horatio wait upon him exit horatio to laertes strengthen your patience in our last night 's speech we 'll put the matter to the present push good gertrude set some watch over your son this grave shall have a living monument an hour of quiet shortly shall we see till then in patience our proceeding be exeunt scene ii a hall in the castle enter hamlet and horatio so much for this sir now shall you see the other you do remember all the circumstance remember it my lord sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep methought i lay worse than the mutines in the bilboes rashly and praised be rashness for it let us know our indiscretion sometimes serves us well when our deep plots do pall and that should teach us there 's a divinity that shapes our ends rough hew them how we will,-- that is most certain up from my cabin my sea gown scarf'd about me in the dark groped i to find out them had my desire finger'd their packet and in fine withdrew to mine own room again making so bold my fears forgetting manners to unseal their grand commission where i found horatio,-- o royal knavery!--an exact command larded with many several sorts of reasons importing denmark 's health and england 's too with ho such bugs and goblins in my life that on the supervise no leisure bated no not to stay the grinding of the axe my head should be struck off is't possible here 's the commission read it at more leisure but wilt thou hear me how i did proceed i beseech you being thus be netted round with villanies,-- ere i could make a prologue to my brains they had begun the play i sat me down devised a new commission wrote it fair i once did hold it as our statists do a baseness to write fair and labour'd much how to forget that learning but sir now it did me yeoman 's service wilt thou know the effect of what i wrote ay good my lord an earnest conjuration from the king as england was his faithful tributary as love between them like the palm might flourish as peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma tween their amities and many such like as'es of great charge that on the view and knowing of these contents without debatement further more or less he should the bearers put to sudden death not shriving time allow'd how was this seal'd why even in that was heaven ordinant i had my father 's signet in my purse which was the model of that danish seal folded the writ up in form of the other subscribed it gave't the impression placed it safely the changeling never known now the next day was our sea fight and what to this was sequent thou know'st already so guildenstern and rosencrantz go to't why man they did make love to this employment they are not near my conscience their defeat does by their own insinuation grow tis dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incensed points of mighty opposites why what a king is this does it not think'st thee stand me now upon-- he that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother popp'd in between the election and my hopes thrown out his angle for my proper life and with such cozenage is't not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm and is't not to be damn'd to let this canker of our nature come in further evil it must be shortly known to him from england what is the issue of the business there it will be short the interim is mine and a man 's life 's no more than to say one but i am very sorry good horatio that to laertes i forgot myself for by the image of my cause i see the portraiture of his i 'll court his favours but sure the bravery of his grief did put me into a towering passion peace who comes here enter osric your lordship is right welcome back to denmark i humbly thank you sir dost know this water fly no my good lord thy state is the more gracious for tis a vice to know him he hath much land and fertile let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the king 's mess tis a chough but as i say spacious in the possession of dirt sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure i should impart a thing to you from his majesty i will receive it sir with all diligence of spirit put your bonnet to his right use tis for the head i thank your lordship it is very hot no believe me tis very cold the wind is northerly it is indifferent cold my lord indeed but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion exceedingly my lord it is very sultry,--as twere,--i can not tell how but my lord his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head sir this is the matter,-- i beseech you remember-- hamlet moves him to put on his hat nay good my lord for mine ease in good faith sir here is newly come to court laertes believe me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent differences of very soft society and great showing indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though i know to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail but in the verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more your lordship speaks most infallibly of him the concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath sir is't not possible to understand in another tongue you will do't sir really what imports the nomination of this gentleman of laertes his purse is empty already all 's golden words are spent of him sir i know you are not ignorant-- i would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not much approve me well sir you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is-- i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself i mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation laid on him by them in his meed he 's unfellowed what 's his weapon rapier and dagger that 's two of his weapons but well the king sir hath wagered with him six barbary horses against the which he has imponed as i take it six french rapiers and poniards with their assigns as girdle hangers and so three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages and of very liberal conceit what call you the carriages i knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done the carriages sir are the hangers the phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides i would it might be hangers till then but on six barbary horses against six french swords their assigns and three liberal conceited carriages that 's the french bet against the danish why is this imponed as you call it the king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him he shall not exceed you three hits he hath laid on twelve for nine and it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer how if i answer no i mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty tis the breathing time of day with me let the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the king hold his purpose i will win for him an i can if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits shall i re deliver you e'en so to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will i commend my duty to your lordship yours yours exit osric he does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else for 's turn this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head he did comply with his dug before he sucked it thus has he and many more of the same bevy that i know the dressy age dotes on only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of yesty collection which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out enter a lord my lord his majesty commended him to you by young osric who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with laertes or that you will take longer time i am constant to my purpose they follow the king 's pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided i be so able as now the king and queen and all are coming down in happy time the queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to laertes before you fall to play she well instructs me exit lord you will lose this wager my lord i do not think so since he went into france i have been in continual practise i shall win at the odds but thou wouldst not think how ill all 's here about my heart but it is no matter nay good my lord,-- it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gain giving as would perhaps trouble a woman if your mind dislike any thing obey it i will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit not a whit we defy augury there 's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow if it be now tis not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come the readiness is all since no man has aught of what he leaves what is't to leave betimes enter king claudius queen gertrude laertes lords osric and attendants with foils   and c come hamlet come and take this hand from me king claudius puts laertes hand into hamlet 's give me your pardon sir i 've done you wrong but pardon't as you are a gentleman this presence knows and you must needs have heard how i am punish'd with sore distraction what i have done that might your nature honour and exception roughly awake i here proclaim was madness was't hamlet wrong'd laertes never hamlet if hamlet from himself be ta'en away and when he 's not himself does wrong laertes then hamlet does it not hamlet denies it who does it then his madness if't be so hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd his madness is poor hamlet 's enemy sir in this audience let my disclaiming from a purposed evil free me so far in your most generous thoughts that i have shot mine arrow o'er the house and hurt my brother i am satisfied in nature whose motive in this case should stir me most to my revenge but in my terms of honour i stand aloof and will no reconcilement till by some elder masters of known honour i have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name ungored but till that time i do receive your offer'd love like love and will not wrong it i embrace it freely and will this brother 's wager frankly play give us the foils come on come one for me i 'll be your foil laertes in mine ignorance your skill shall like a star i the darkest night stick fiery off indeed you mock me sir no by this hand give them the foils young osric cousin hamlet you know the wager very well my lord your grace hath laid the odds o the weaker side i do not fear it i have seen you both but since he is better'd we have therefore odds this is too heavy let me see another this likes me well these foils have all a length they prepare to play ay my good lord set me the stoops of wine upon that table if hamlet give the first or second hit or quit in answer of the third exchange let all the battlements their ordnance fire the king shall drink to hamlet 's better breath and in the cup an union shall he throw richer than that which four successive kings in denmark 's crown have worn give me the cups and let the kettle to the trumpet speak the trumpet to the cannoneer without the cannons to the heavens the heavens to earth now the king dunks to hamlet come begin and you the judges bear a wary eye come on sir come my lord they play one no judgment a hit a very palpable hit well again stay give me drink hamlet this pearl is thine here 's to thy health trumpets sound and cannon shot off within give him the cup i 'll play this bout first set it by awhile come they play another hit what say you a touch a touch i do confess our son shall win he 's fat and scant of breath here hamlet take my napkin rub thy brows the queen carouses to thy fortune hamlet good madam gertrude do not drink i will my lord i pray you pardon me aside   it is the poison'd cup it is too late i dare not drink yet madam by and by come let me wipe thy face my lord i 'll hit him now i do not think't aside   and yet tis almost gainst my conscience come for the third laertes you but dally i pray you pass with your best violence i am afeard you make a wanton of me say you so come on they play nothing neither way have at you now laertes wounds hamlet then in scuffling they change rapiers and hamlet wounds laertes part them they are incensed nay come again queen gertrude falls look to

forgiveness with me noble hamlet mine and my father 's death come not upon thee nor thine on me dies heaven make thee free of it i follow thee i am dead horatio wretched queen adieu you that look pale

have't o good horatio what a wounded name things standing thus unknown shall live behind me if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart absent thee from felicity awhile and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain to tell my story march afar off and shot within what warlike noise is this young fortinbras with conquest come from poland to the ambassadors of england gives this warlike volley o i die horatio the potent poison quite o'er crows my spirit i can not live to hear the news from england but i do prophesy the election lights on fortinbras he has my dying voice so tell him with the occurrents more and less which have solicited the rest is silence dies now cracks a noble heart good night sweet prince and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest why does the drum come hither march within enter fortinbras the english ambassadors and others where is this sight what is it ye would see if aught of woe or wonder cease your search this quarry cries on havoc o proud death what feast is toward in thine eternal cell that thou so many princes at a shot so bloodily hast struck the sight is dismal and our affairs from england come too late the ears are senseless that should give us hearing to tell him his commandment is fulfill'd that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead where should we have our thanks not from his mouth had it the ability of life to thank you he never gave commandment for their death but since so jump upon this bloody question you from the polack wars and you from england are here arrived give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view and let me speak to the yet unknowing world how these things came about so shall you hear of carnal bloody and unnatural acts of accidental judgments casual slaughters of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause and in this upshot purposes mistook fall'n on the inventors reads all this can i truly deliver let us haste to hear it and call the noblest to the audience for me with sorrow i embrace my fortune i have some rights of memory in this kingdom which now to claim my vantage doth invite me of that i shall have also cause to speak and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more but let this same be presently perform'd even while men 's minds are wild lest more mischance on plots and errors happen let four captains bear hamlet like a soldier to the stage for he was likely had he been put on to have proved most royally and for his passage the soldiers music and the rites of war speak loudly for him take up the bodies such a sight as this becomes the field but here shows much amiss go bid the soldiers shoot a dead march exeunt bearing off the dead bodies after which a peal of ordnance is shot off ", "A Midsummer nights dream": "act i scene i. athens the palace of

lysander thou hast given her rhymes and interchanged love tokens with my child thou hast by moonlight at her window sung with feigning voice verses of feigning love and stolen the impression of her fantasy with bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceits knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth with cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter 's heart turn'd her obedience which is due to me to stubborn harshness and my gracious duke be it so she will not here before your grace consent to marry with demetrius i beg the ancient privilege of athens as she is mine i may dispose of her which shall be either to this gentleman or to her death according to our law immediately provided in that case what say you hermia be advised fair maid to you your father should be as a god one that composed your beauties yea and one to whom you are but as a form in wax by him imprinted and within his power to leave the figure or disfigure it demetrius is a worthy gentleman so is lysander in himself he is but in this kind wanting your father 's voice the other must be held the worthier i would my father look'd but with my eyes rather your eyes must with his judgment look i do entreat your grace to pardon me i know not by what power i am made bold nor how it may concern my modesty in such a presence here to plead my thoughts but i beseech your grace that i may know the worst that may befall me in this case if i refuse to we d demetrius either to die the death or to abjure for ever the society of men therefore fair hermia question your desires know of your youth examine well your blood whether if you yield not to your father 's choice you can endure the livery of a nun for aye to be in shady cloister mew'd to live a barren sister all your

love why is your cheek so pale how chance the roses there do fade so fast belike for want of rain which i could well beteem them from the tempest of my eyes ay me for aught that i could ever read could ever hear by tale or history the course of true love never did run smooth but either it was different in blood,-- o cross too high to be enthrall'd to low or else misgraffed in respect of years,-- o spite too old to be engaged to young or else it stood upon the choice of friends,-- o hell to choose love by another 's eyes or if there were a sympathy in choice war death or sickness did lay siege to it making it momentany as a sound swift as a shadow short as any dream brief as the lightning in the collied night that in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth and ere a man hath power to say behold the jaws of darkness do devour it up so quick bright things come to confusion if then true lovers have been ever cross'd it stands as an edict in destiny then let us teach our trial patience because it is a customary cross as due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs wishes and tears poor fancy 's followers a good persuasion therefore hear me hermia i have a widow aunt a dowager of great revenue and she hath no child from athens is her house remote seven leagues and she respects me as her only son there gentle hermia may i marry thee and to that place the sharp

to a morn of may there will i stay for thee my good lysander i swear to thee by cupid 's strongest bow by his best arrow with the golden head by the simplicity of venus doves by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves and by that fire which burn'd the carthage queen when the false troyan under sail was seen by all the vows that ever men have broke in number more than ever women spoke in

primrose beds were wo nt to lie emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet there my lysander and myself shall meet and thence from athens turn away our eyes to seek new friends and stranger companies farewell sweet playfellow pray thou for us and good luck grant thee thy demetrius keep word lysander we must starve our sight from lovers food till morrow deep midnight i will my hermia exit hermia helena adieu as you on him demetrius dote on you exit how happy some o'er other some can be through athens i am thought as fair as she but what of that demetrius thinks not so he will not know what all but he do know and as he errs doting on hermia 's eyes so i admiring of his qualities things base and vile folding no quantity love can transpose to form and dignity love looks not with the eyes but with the mind and therefore is wing'd cupid painted blind nor hath love 's mind of any judgement taste wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste and therefore is love said to be a child because in choice he is so oft beguiled as waggish boys in game themselves forswear so the boy love is perjured every where for ere demetrius look'd on hermia 's eyne he hail'd down oaths that he was only mine and when this hail some heat from hermia felt so he dissolved and showers of oaths did melt i will go tell him of fair hermia 's flight then to the wood will he to morrow night pursue her and for this

spirit whither wander you over hill over dale thorough bush thorough brier over park over pale thorough flood thorough fire i do wander everywhere swifter than the moon 's sphere and i serve the fairy queen to dew her orbs upon the green the cowslips tall her pensioners be in their gold coats spots you see those be rubies fairy favours in those freckles live their savours i must go seek some dewdrops here and hang a pearl in every cowslip 's ear farewell thou lob of spirits i 'll be gone our queen and all our elves come here anon the king doth keep his revels here to night take heed the queen come not within his sight for oberon is passing fell and wrath because that she as her attendant hath a lovely boy stolen from an indian king she never had so sweet a changeling and jealous oberon would have the child knight of his train to trace the forests wild but she perforce withholds the loved boy crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy and now they never meet in grove or green by fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen but they do square that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups and hide them there either i mistake your shape and making quite or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite call'd robin goodfellow are not you he that frights the maidens of the villagery skim milk and sometimes labour in the quern and bootless make the breathless housewife churn and sometime make the drink to bear no barm mislead night wanderers laughing at their harm those that hobgoblin call you and sweet puck you do their work and they shall have good luck are not you he thou speak'st aright i am that merry wanderer of the night i jest to oberon and make him smile when i a fat and bean fed horse beguile neighing in likeness of a filly foal and sometime lurk i in a gossip 's bowl in very likeness of a roasted crab and when she drinks against her lips i bob and on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale the wisest aunt telling the saddest tale sometime for three foot stool mistaketh me then slip i from her bum down topples she and tailor cries and falls into a cough and then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh and waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear a merrier hour was never wasted there but room fairy here comes oberon and here my mistress would that he were gone enter from one side oberon with his train from the other titania with hers ill met by moonlight proud titania what jealous oberon fairies skip hence i have forsworn his bed and company tarry rash wanton am not i thy lord then i must be thy lady but i know when thou hast stolen away from fairy land and in the shape of corin sat all day playing on pipes of corn and versing love to amorous phillida why art thou here come from the farthest steppe of india but that forsooth the bouncing amazon your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love to theseus must be wedded and you come to give their bed joy and prosperity how canst thou thus for shame titania glance at my credit with hippolyta knowing i know thy love to theseus didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night from perigenia whom he ravished and make him with fair aegle break his faith with ariadne and antiopa these are the forgeries of jealousy and never since the middle summer 's spring met we on hill in dale forest or mead by paved fountain or by rushy brook or in the beached margent of the sea to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind but with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport therefore the winds piping to us in vain as in revenge have suck'd up from the sea contagious fogs which falling in the land have every pelting river made so proud that they have overborne their continents the ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain the ploughman lost his sweat and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard the fold stands empty in the drowned field and crows are fatted with the murrion flock the nine men 's morris is fill'd up with mud and the quaint mazes in the wanton green for lack of tread are undistinguishable the human mortals want their winter here no night is now with hymn or carol blest therefore the moon the governess of floods pale in her anger washes all the air that rheumatic diseases do abound and thorough this distemperature we see the seasons alter hoary headed frosts far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose and on old hiems thin and icy crown an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds is as in mockery set the spring the summer the childing autumn angry winter change their wonted liveries and the mazed world by their increase now knows not which is which and this same progeny of evils comes from our debate from our dissension we are their parents and original do you amend it then it lies in you why should titania cross her oberon i do but beg a little changeling boy to be my henchman set your heart at rest the fairy land buys not the child of me his mother was a votaress of my order and in the spiced indian air by night full often hath she gossip'd by my side and sat with me on neptune 's yellow sands marking the embarked traders on the flood when we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive and grow big bellied with the wanton wind which she with pretty and with swimming gait following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,-- would imitate and sail upon the land to fetch me trifles and return again as from a voyage rich with merchandise but she being mortal of that boy did die and for her sake do i rear up her boy and for her sake i will not part with him how long within this wood intend you stay perchance till after theseus wedding day if you will patiently dance in our round and see our moonlight revels go with us if not shun me and i will spare your haunts give me that boy and i will go with thee not for thy fairy kingdom fairies away we shall chide downright if i longer stay exit titania with her train well go thy way thou shalt not from this grove till i torment thee for this injury my gentle puck come hither thou rememberest since once i sat upon a promontory and heard a mermaid on a dolphin 's back uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath that the rude sea grew civil at her song and certain stars shot madly from their spheres to hear the sea maid 's music i remember that very time i saw but thou couldst not flying between the cold moon and the earth cupid all arm'd a certain aim he took at a fair vestal throned by the west and loosed his love shaft smartly from his bow as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts but i might see young cupid 's fiery shaft quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon and the imperial votaress passed on in maiden meditation fancy free yet mark'd i where the bolt of cupid fell it fell upon a little western flower before milk white now purple with love 's wound and maidens call it love in idleness fetch me that flower the herb i shew'd thee once the juice of it on sleeping eye lids laid will make or man or woman madly dote upon the next live creature that it sees fetch me this herb and be thou here again ere the leviathan can swim a league i 'll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes exit having once this juice i 'll watch titania when she is asleep and drop the liquor of it in her eyes the next thing then she waking looks upon be it on lion bear or wolf or bull on meddling monkey or on busy ape she shall pursue it with the soul of love and ere i take this charm from off her sight as i can take it with another herb i 'll make her render up her page to me but who comes here i am invisible and i will overhear their conference enter demetrius helena following him i love thee not therefore pursue me not where is lysander and fair hermia the one i 'll slay the other slayeth me thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood and here am i and wode within this wood because i can not meet my hermia hence get thee gone and follow me no more you draw me you hard hearted adamant but yet you draw not iron for my heart is true as steel leave you your power to draw and i shall have no power to follow you do i entice you do i speak you fair or rather do i not in plainest truth tell you i do not nor i can not love you and even for that do i love you the more i am your spaniel and demetrius the more you beat me i will fawn on you use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me neglect me lose me only give me leave unworthy as i am to follow you what worser place can i beg in your love,-- and yet a place of high respect with me,-- than to be used as you use your dog tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit for i am sick when i do look on thee and i am sick when i look not on you you do impeach your modesty too much to leave the city and commit yourself into the hands of one that loves you not to trust the opportunity of night and the ill counsel of a desert place with the rich worth of your virginity your virtue is my privilege for that it is not night when i do see your face therefore i think i am not in the night nor doth this wood lack worlds of company for you in my respect are all the world then how can it be said i am alone when all the world is here to look on me i 'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts the wildest hath not such a heart as you run when you will the story shall be changed apollo flies and daphne holds the chase the dove pursues the griffin the mild hind makes speed to catch the tiger bootless speed when cowardice pursues and valour flies i will not stay thy questions let me go or if thou follow me do not believe but i shall do thee mischief in the wood ay in the temple in the town the field you do me mischief fie demetrius your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex we can not fight for love as men may do we should be wood and were not made to woo exit demetrius i 'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell to die upon the hand i love so well exit fare thee well nymph ere he do leave this grove thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love re enter puck hast thou the flower there welcome wanderer ay there it is i pray thee give it me i know a bank where the wild thyme blows where oxlips and the nodding violet grows quite over canopied with luscious woodbine with sweet musk roses and with eglantine there sleeps titania sometime of the night lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight and there the snake throws her enamell'd skin weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in and with the juice of this i 'll streak her eyes and make her full of hateful fantasies take thou some of it and seek through this grove a sweet athenian lady is in love with a disdainful youth anoint his eyes but do it when the next thing he espies may be the lady thou shalt know the man by the athenian garments he hath on effect it with some care that he may prove more fond on her than she upon her love and look thou meet me ere the first cock crow fear not my lord your servant shall do

not a whit i have a device to make all well write me a prologue and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords and that pyramus is not killed indeed and for the more better assurance tell them that i pyramus am not pyramus but bottom the weaver this will put them out of fear well we will have such a prologue and it shall be written in eight and six no make it two more let it be written in eight and eight will not the ladies be afeard of the lion i fear it i promise you masters you ought to consider with yourselves to bring in god shield us!--a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing for there is not a more fearful wild fowl than your lion living and we ought to look to t. therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion nay you must name his name and half his face must be seen through the lion 's neck and he himself must speak through saying thus or to the same defect,--'ladies,'--or fair ladies i would wish you,'--or i would request you,'--or i would entreat you,--not to fear not to tremble my life for yours if you think i come hither as a lion it were pity of my life no i am no such thing i am a man as other men are and there indeed let him name his name and tell them plainly he is snug the joiner well it shall be so but there is two hard things that is to bring the moonlight into a chamber for you know pyramus and thisby meet by moonlight doth the moon shine that night we play our play a calendar a calendar look in the almanac find out moonshine find out moonshine yes it doth shine that night why then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window where we play open and the moon may shine in at the casement ay or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lanthorn and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person of moonshine then there is another thing we must have a wall in the great chamber for pyramus and thisby says the story did talk through the chink of a wall you can never bring in a wall what say you bottom some man or other must present wall and let him have some plaster or some loam or some rough cast about him to signify wall and let him hold his fingers thus and through that cranny shall pyramus and thisby whisper if that may be then all is well come sit   down every mother 's son and rehearse your parts pyramus you begin when you have spoken your speech enter into that

rule now about this haunted grove my mistress with a monster is in love near to her close and consecrated bower while she was in her dull and sleeping hour a crew of patches rude mechanicals that work for bread upon athenian stalls were met together to rehearse a play intended for great theseus nuptial day the shallowest thick skin of that barren sort who pyramus presented in their sport forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake when i did him at this advantage take an ass 's nole i fixed on his head anon his thisbe must be answered and forth my mimic comes when they him spy as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye or russet pated choughs many in sort rising and cawing at the gun 's report sever themselves and madly sweep the sky so at his sight away his fellows fly and at our stamp here o'er and o'er one falls he murder cries and help from athens calls their sense thus weak lost with their fears thus strong made senseless things begin to do them wrong for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch some sleeves some hats from yielders all things catch i led them on in this distracted fear and left sweet pyramus translated there when in that moment so it came to pass titania waked and straightway loved an ass this falls out better than i could devise but hast thou yet latch'd the athenian 's eyes with the love juice as i did bid thee do i took him sleeping,--that is finish'd too,-- and the athenian woman by his side that when he waked of force she must be eyed enter hermia and demetrius stand close this is the same athenian this is the woman but not this the man o why

knew courtesy you would not do me thus much injury can you not hate me as i know you do but you must join in souls to mock me too if you were men as men you are in show you would not use a gentle lady so to vow and swear and superpraise my parts when i am sure you hate me with your hearts you both are rivals and love hermia and now both rivals to mock helena a trim exploit a manly enterprise to conjure tears up in a poor maid 's eyes with your derision none of noble sort would so offend a virgin and extort a poor soul 's patience all to make you sport you are unkind demetrius be not so for

eye his function takes the ear more quick of apprehension makes wherein it doth impair the seeing sense it pays the hearing double recompense thou art not by mine eye lysander found mine ear i thank it brought me to thy sound but why unkindly didst thou leave me so why should he stay whom love doth press to go what love could press lysander from my side lysander 's love that would not let him bide fair helena who more engilds the night than all you fiery oes and eyes of light why seek'st thou me could not this make thee know the hate i bear thee made me leave thee so you speak not as you think it can not be lo she is one of this confederacy now i perceive they have conjoin'd all three to fashion this false sport in spite of me injurious hermia most ungrateful maid have you conspired have you with these contrived to bait me with this foul derision is all the counsel that we two have shared the sisters vows the hours that we have spent when we have chid the hasty footed time for parting us,--o is it all forgot all school days friendship childhood innocence we hermia like two artificial gods have with our needles created both one flower both on one sampler sitting on one cushion both warbling of one song both in one key as if our hands our sides voices and minds had been incorporate so we grow together like to a double cherry seeming parted but yet an union in partition two lovely berries moulded on one stem so with two seeming bodies but one heart two of the first like coats in heraldry due but to one and crowned with one crest and will you rent our ancient love asunder to join with men in scorning your poor friend it is not friendly tis not maidenly our sex as well as i may chide you for it though i alone do feel the injury i am amazed at your passionate words i scorn you not it seems that you scorn me have you not set lysander as in scorn to follow me and praise my eyes and face and made your other love demetrius who even but now did spurn me with his foot to call me goddess nymph divine and rare precious celestial wherefore speaks he this to her he hates and wherefore doth lysander deny your love so rich within his soul and tender me forsooth affection but by your setting on by your consent what thought i be not so in grace as you so hung upon with love so fortunate but miserable most to love unloved this you should pity rather than despise i understand not what you mean by this ay do persever counterfeit sad looks make mouths upon me when i turn my back wink each at other hold the sweet jest up this sport well carried shall be chronicled if you have any pity grace or manners you would not make me such an argument but fare ye well tis partly my own fault which death or absence soon shall remedy stay gentle helena hear my

and prove it too quick come lysander whereto tends all this away you ethiope no no he 'll         seem to break loose take on as you would follow but yet come not you are a tame man go hang off thou cat thou burr vile thing let loose or i will shake thee from me like a serpent why are you grown so rude what change is this sweet love,-- thy love out tawny tartar out out loathed medicine hated potion hence do you not jest yes sooth and so do you demetrius i will keep my word with thee i would i had your bond for i perceive a weak bond holds you i 'll not trust your word what should i hurt

fair now as i was erewhile since night you loved me yet since night you left me why then you left me o the gods forbid!-- in earnest shall i say ay by my life and never did desire to see thee more

and stolen my love 's heart from him fine i'faith have you no modesty no maiden shame no touch of bashfulness what will you tear impatient answers from my gentle tongue fie fie you counterfeit you puppet you puppet why so ay that way goes the game now i perceive that she hath made compare between our statures she hath urged her height and with her personage her tall personage her height forsooth she hath prevail'd with him and are you grown so high in his esteem because i am so dwarfish and so low how low am i thou painted maypole speak how low am i i am not yet so low but that my nails can reach unto thine eyes i pray you though you mock me gentlemen let her not hurt me i was never curst i have no gift at all in shrewishness i am a right maid for my cowardice let her not strike me you perhaps may think because she is something lower than myself that i can match her lower hark again good hermia do not be so bitter with me i evermore did love you hermia did ever keep your counsels never wrong'd you save that in love unto demetrius i told him of your stealth unto this wood he follow'd you for love i follow'd him but he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me to strike

flowers and that same dew which sometime on the buds was wo nt to swell like round and orient pearls stood now within the pretty flowerets eyes like tears that did their own disgrace bewail when i had at my pleasure taunted her and she in mild terms begg'd my patience i then did ask of her her changeling child which straight she gave me and her fairy sent to bear him to my bower in fairy land and

dispatch i say and find the forester exit an attendant we will fair queen up to the mountain 's top and mark the musical confusion of hounds and echo in conjunction i was with hercules and cadmus once when in a wood of crete they bay'd the bear with hounds of sparta never did i hear such gallant chiding for besides the groves the skies the fountains every region near seem'd all one mutual cry i never heard so musical a discord such sweet thunder my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind so flew'd so sanded and their heads are hung with ears that sweep away the morning dew crook knee'd and dew lapp'd like thessalian bulls slow in pursuit but match'd in mouth like bells each under each a cry more tuneable was never holla'd to nor cheer'd with horn in crete in sparta nor in thessaly judge when you hear but soft what nymphs are these my lord this is my daughter here asleep and this lysander this demetrius is this helena old nedar 's helena i wonder of their being here together no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may and hearing our intent came here in grace our solemnity but speak egeus is not this the day that hermia should give answer of her choice it is my lord go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns horns and shout within lysander demetrius helena and hermia wake and start up good morrow friends saint valentine is past begin these wood birds but to couple now pardon my lord i pray you all stand up i know you two are rival enemies how comes this gentle concord in the world that hatred is so far from jealousy to sleep by hate and fear no enmity my lord i shall reply amazedly half sleep half waking but as yet i swear i can not truly say how i came here but as i think,--for truly would i speak and now do i bethink me so it is,-- i came with hermia hither our intent was to be gone from athens where we might without the peril of the athenian law enough enough my lord you have enough i beg the law the law upon his head they would have stolen away they would demetrius thereby to have defeated you and me you of your wife and me of my consent of my consent that she should be your wife my lord fair helen told me of their stealth of this their purpose hither to this wood and i in fury hither follow'd them fair helena in fancy following me but my good lord i wot not by what power,-- but by some power it is,--my love to hermia melted as the snow seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaud which in my childhood i did dote upon and all the faith the virtue of my heart the object and the pleasure of mine eye is only helena to her my lord was i betroth'd ere i saw hermia but like in sickness did i loathe this food but as in health come to my natural taste now i do wish it love it long for it and will for evermore be true to it fair lovers you are fortunately met of this discourse we more will hear anon egeus i will overbear your will for in the temple by and by with us these couples shall eternally be knit and for the morning now is something worn our purposed hunting shall be set aside away with us to athens three and three we 'll hold a feast in great solemnity come hippolyta exeunt theseus hippolyta egeus and train these things seem small and undistinguishable methinks i see these things with parted eye when every thing seems double so methinks and i have found demetrius like a jewel mine own and not mine own are you sure that we are awake it seems to me that yet we sleep we dream do not you think the duke was here and bid us follow him yea and my father and hippolyta and he did bid us follow to the temple why then we are awake let 's follow him and by the way let us recount our dreams exeunt awaking   when my cue comes call me and i will answer my next is most fair pyramus heigh ho peter quince flute the bellows mender snout the tinker starveling god 's my life stolen hence and left me asleep i have had a most rare vision i have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream methought i was there is no man can tell what methought i was,--and methought i had,--but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought i had the eye of man hath not heard the ear of man hath not seen man 's hand is not able to taste his tongue to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream was i will get peter quince to write a ballad of this dream it shall be called bottom 's dream because it hath no bottom and i will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke peradventure to make it the more gracious i shall sing it at her death exit scene ii athens quince 's house enter quince flute snout and starveling have you sent to bottom 's house is he come home yet he can not be heard of out of doubt he is transported if he come not then the play is marred it goes not forward doth it it is not possible you have not a man in all athens able to discharge pyramus but he no he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens yea and the best person too and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice you must say paragon a paramour is god bless us a thing of naught enter snug masters the duke is coming from the temple and there is two or three lords and ladies more married if our sport had gone forward we had all been made men o sweet bully bottom thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life he could not have scaped sixpence a day an the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing pyramus i 'll be hanged he would have deserved it sixpence a day in pyramus or nothing enter bottom where are these lads where are these hearts bottom o most courageous day o most happy hour masters i am to discourse wonders but ask me not what for if i tell you i am no true athenian i will tell you every thing right as it fell out let us hear sweet bottom not a word of me all that i will tell you is that the duke hath dined get your apparel together good strings to your beards new ribbons to your pumps meet presently at the palace every man look o'er his part for the short and the long is our play is preferred in any case let thisby have clean linen and let not him that plays the lion pair his nails for they shall hang out for the lion 's claws and most dear actors eat no onions nor garlic for we are to utter sweet breath and i do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy no more words away go away exeunt act v scene i. athens the palace of theseus enter theseus hippolyta philostrate lords and attendants tis strange my theseus that these lovers speak of more strange than true i never may believe these antique fables nor these fairy toys lovers and madmen have such seething brains such shaping fantasies that apprehend more than cool reason ever comprehends the lunatic the lover and the poet are of imagination all compact one sees more devils than vast hell can hold that is the madman the lover all as frantic sees helen 's beauty in a brow of egypt the poet 's eye in fine frenzy rolling doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven and as imagination bodies forth the forms of things unknown the poet 's pen turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name such tricks hath strong imagination that if it would but apprehend some joy it comprehends some bringer of that joy or in the night imagining some fear how easy is a bush supposed a bear but all the story of the night told over and all their minds transfigured so together more witnesseth than fancy 's images and grows to something of great constancy but howsoever strange and admirable here come the lovers full of joy and mirth enter lysander demetrius hermia and helena joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts more than to us wait in your royal walks your board your bed come now what masques what dances shall we have to wear away this long age of three hours between our after supper and bed time where is our usual manager of mirth what revels are in hand is there no play to ease the anguish of a torturing hour call philostrate here mighty theseus say what abridgement have you for this evening what masque what music how shall we beguile the lazy time if not with some delight there is a brief how many sports are ripe make choice of which your highness will see first giving a paper reads   the battle with the centaurs to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp we 'll none of that that have i told my love in glory of my kinsman hercules reads the riot of the tipsy bacchanals tearing the thracian singer in their rage that is an old device and it was play'd when i from thebes came last a conqueror reads the thrice three muses mourning for the death of learning late deceased in beggary that is some satire keen and critical not sorting with a nuptial ceremony reads a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe very tragical mirth merry and tragical tedious and brief that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow how shall we find the concord of this discord a play there is my lord some ten words long which is as brief as i have known a play but by ten words my lord it is too long which makes it tedious for in all the play there is not one word apt one player fitted and tragical my noble lord it is for pyramus therein doth kill himself which when i saw rehearsed i must confess made mine eyes water but more merry tears the passion of loud laughter never shed what are they that do play it hard handed men that work in athens here which never labour'd in their minds till now and now have toil'd their unbreathed memories with this same play against your nuptial and we will hear it no my noble lord it is not for you i have heard it over and it is nothing nothing in the world unless you can find sport in their intents extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain to do you service i will hear that play for never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it go bring them in and take your places ladies exit philostrate i love not to see wretchedness o'er charged and duty in his service perishing why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing he says they can do nothing in this kind the kinder we to give them thanks for nothing our sport shall be to take what they mistake and what poor duty can not do noble respect takes it in might not merit where i have come great clerks have purposed to greet me with premeditated welcomes where i have seen them shiver and look pale make periods in the midst of sentences throttle their practised accent in their fears and in conclusion dumbly have broke off not paying me a welcome trust me sweet out of this silence yet i pick'd a welcome and in the modesty of fearful duty i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence love therefore and tongue tied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity re enter philostrate so please your grace the prologue is address'd let him approach flourish of trumpets enter quince for the prologue if we offend it is with our good will that you should think we come not to offend but with good will to show our simple skill that is the true beginning of our end consider then we come but in despite we do not come as minding to contest you our true intent is all for your delight we are not here that you should here repent you the actors are at hand and by their show you shall know all that you are like to know this fellow doth not stand upon points he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows not the stop a good moral my lord it is not enough to speak but to speak true indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorder a sound but not in government his speech was like a tangled chain nothing impaired but all disordered who is next enter pyramus and thisbe wall moonshine and lion gentles perchance you wonder at this show but wonder on till truth make all things plain this man is pyramus if you would know this beauteous lady thisby is certain this man with lime and rough cast doth present wall that vile wall which did these lovers sunder and through wall 's chink poor souls they are content to whisper at the which let no man wonder this man with lanthorn dog and bush of thorn presenteth moonshine for if you will know by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn to meet at ninus tomb there there to woo this grisly beast which lion hight by name the trusty thisby coming first by night did scare away or rather did affright and as she fled her mantle she did fall which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain anon comes pyramus sweet youth and tall and finds his trusty thisby 's mantle slain whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade he bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast and thisby tarrying in mulberry shade his dagger drew and died for all the rest let lion moonshine wall and lovers twain at large discourse while here they do remain exeunt prologue thisbe lion and moonshine i wonder if the lion be to speak no wonder my lord one lion may when many asses do in this same interlude it doth befall that i one snout by name present a wall and such a wall as i would have you think that had in it a crannied hole or chink through which the lovers pyramus and thisby did whisper often very secretly this loam this rough cast and this stone doth show that i am that same wall the truth is so and this the cranny is right and sinister through which the fearful lovers are to whisper would you desire lime and hair to speak better it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse my lord enter pyramus pyramus draws near the wall silence o grim look'd night o night with hue so black o night which ever art when day is not o night o night alack alack alack i fear my thisby 's promise is forgot and thou o wall o sweet o lovely wall that stand'st between her father 's ground and mine thou wall o wall o sweet and lovely wall show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne wall holds up his fingers thanks courteous wall jove shield thee well for this but what see i no thisby do i see o wicked wall through whom i see no bliss cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me the wall methinks being sensible should curse again no in truth sir he should not deceiving me is thisby 's cue she is to enter now and i am to spy her through the wall you shall see it will fall pat as i told you yonder she comes enter thisbe o wall full often hast thou heard my moans for parting my fair pyramus and me my cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee i see a voice now will i to the chink to spy an i can hear my thisby 's face thisby my love thou art my love i think think what thou wilt i am thy lover 's grace and like limander am i trusty still and i like helen till the fates me kill not shafalus to procrus was so true as shafalus to procrus i to you o kiss me through the hole of this vile wall i kiss the wall 's hole not your lips at all wilt thou at ninny 's tomb meet me straightway tide life tide death i come without delay exeunt pyramus and thisbe thus have i wall my part discharged so and being done thus wall away doth go exit now is the mural down between the two neighbours no remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear without warning this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard the best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them it must be your imagination then and not theirs if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves they may pass for excellent men here come two noble beasts in a man and a lion enter lion and moonshine you ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor may now perchance both quake and tremble here when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar then know that i one snug the joiner am a lion fell nor else no lion 's dam for if i should as lion come in strife into this place twere pity on my life a very gentle beast of a good conscience the very best at a beast my lord that e'er i saw this lion is a very fox for his valour true and a goose for his discretion not so my

while you were there while i was there and did he search for you and could not find you you shall hear as good luck would have it comes in one mistress page gives intelligence of ford 's approach and in her invention and ford 's wife 's distraction they conveyed me into a buck basket a buck basket by the lord a buck basket rammed me in with foul shirts and smocks socks foul stockings greasy napkins that master brook there was the rankest compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril and how long lay you there nay you shall hear master brook what i have suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good being thus crammed in the basket a couple of ford 's knaves his hinds were called forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to datchet lane they took me on their shoulders met the jealous knave their master in the door who asked them once or twice what they had in their basket i quaked for fear lest the lunatic knave would have searched it but fate ordaining he should be a cuckold held his hand well on went he for a search and away went i for foul clothes but mark the sequel master brook i suffered the pangs of three several deaths first an intolerable fright to be detected with a jealous rotten bell wether next to be compassed like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck hilt to point heel to head and then to be stopped in like a strong distillation with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease think of that,--a man of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subject to heat as butter a man of continual dissolution and thaw it was a miracle to scape suffocation and in the height of this bath when i was more than half stewed in grease like a dutch dish to be thrown into the thames and cooled glowing hot in that surge like a horse shoe think of that,--hissing hot,--think of that master brook in good sadness i am sorry that for my sake you have sufferd all this my suit then is desperate you 'll undertake her no more

east a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad where underneath the grove of sycamore that westward rooteth from the city 's side so early walking did i see your son towards him i made but he was ware of me and stole into the covert of the wood i measuring his affections by my own that most are busied when they 're most alone pursued my humour not pursuing his and gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me many a morning hath he there been seen with tears augmenting the fresh morning dew adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs but all so soon as the all cheering sun should in the furthest east begin to draw the shady curtains from aurora 's bed away from the light steals home my heavy son and private in his chamber pens himself shuts up his windows locks far daylight out and makes himself an artificial night black and portentous must this humour prove unless good counsel may the cause remove my noble uncle do you know the cause i neither know it nor can learn of him have you importuned him by any means both by myself and many other friends but he his own affections counsellor is to himself i will not say how true-- but to himself so secret and so close so far from sounding and discovery as is the bud bit with an envious worm ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air or dedicate his beauty to the sun could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow we would as willingly give cure as know enter romeo see where he comes so please you step aside i 'll know his grievance or be much denied i would thou wert so happy by thy stay to hear true shrift come madam

smoke cold fire sick health still waking sleep that is not what it is this love feel i that feel no love in this dost thou not laugh no coz i rather weep good heart at what at thy good heart 's oppression why such is love 's transgression griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast which thou wilt propagate to have it prest with more of thine this love that thou hast shown doth add more grief to too much of mine own love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs being purged a fire sparkling in lovers eyes being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers tears what is it else a madness most discreet a choking gall and a preserving sweet farewell my coz soft i will go along an if you leave me so you do me wrong tut i have lost myself i am not here this is not romeo he 's some other where tell me in sadness who is that you love what shall i groan and tell thee groan why no but sadly tell me who bid a sick man in sadness make his will ah word ill urged to one that is so ill in sadness cousin i

assailing eyes nor ope her lap to saint seducing gold o she is rich in beauty only poor that when she dies with beauty dies her store then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste she hath and in that sparing makes huge waste for beauty starved with her severity cuts beauty off from all posterity she is too fair too wise wisely too fair to merit bliss by making me despair she hath forsworn to love and in that vow do i live dead that live to tell it now be ruled by me forget to think of her o teach me how i should forget to think by giving liberty unto thine eyes examine other beauties

shall blush for me come knock and enter and no sooner in but every man betake him to his legs a torch for me let wantons light of heart tickle the senseless rushes with their heels for i am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase i 'll be a candle holder and look on the game was ne'er so fair and i am done tut dun 's the mouse the constable 's own word if thou art dun we 'll draw thee from the mire of this sir reverence love wherein thou stick'st up to the ears come we burn daylight ho nay that 's not so i mean sir in delay we waste our lights in vain like lamps by day take our good meaning for our judgment sits five times in that ere once in our five wits and we mean well in going to this mask but tis no wit to go why may one ask i dream'd a dream to night and so did i. well what was yours that dreamers often lie in bed asleep while they do dream things true o then i see queen mab hath been with you she is the fairies midwife and she comes in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman drawn with a team of little atomies athwart men 's noses as they lie asleep her wagon spokes made of long spiders legs the cover of the wings of grasshoppers the traces of the smallest spider 's web the collars of the moonshine 's watery beams her whip of cricket 's bone the lash of film her wagoner a small grey coated gnat not so big as a round little worm prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid her chariot is an empty hazel nut made by the joiner squirrel or old grub time out o mind the fairies coachmakers and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers brains and then they dream of love o'er courtiers knees that dream on court'sies straight o'er lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees o'er ladies lips who straight on kisses dream which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are sometime she gallops o'er a courtier 's nose and then dreams he of smelling out a suit and sometime comes she with a tithe pig 's tail tickling a parson 's nose as a lies asleep then dreams he of another benefice sometime she driveth o'er a soldier 's neck and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades of healths five fathom deep and then anon drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again this is that very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs which once untangled much misfortune bodes this is the hag when maids lie on their backs that presses them and learns them first to bear making them women of good carriage this is she-- peace peace mercutio peace thou talk'st of nothing true i talk of dreams which are the children of an idle brain begot of nothing but vain fantasy which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind who wooes even now the frozen bosom of the north and being anger'd puffs away from thence turning

romeo that spoke him fair bade him bethink how nice the quarrel was and urged withal your high displeasure all this uttered with gentle breath calm look knees humbly bow'd could not take truce with the unruly spleen of tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts with piercing steel at bold mercutio 's breast who all as hot turns deadly point to point and with a martial scorn with one hand beats cold death aside and with the other sends it back to tybalt whose dexterity retorts it romeo he cries aloud hold friends friends part and swifter than his tongue his agile arm beats down their fatal points and twixt them rushes underneath whose arm an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life of stout mercutio and then tybalt fled but by and by comes back to romeo who had but newly entertain'd revenge and to t they go like lightning for ere i could draw to part them was stout tybalt slain and as he fell did romeo turn and fly this is the truth or let benvolio die he is a kinsman to the montague affection makes him false he speaks not true some twenty of them fought in this black strife and all those twenty could but kill one life i beg for justice which thou prince must give romeo slew

their head their true descent and then will i be general of your woes and lead you even to death meantime forbear and let mischance be slave to patience bring forth the parties of suspicion i am the greatest able to do least yet most suspected as the time and place doth make against me of this direful murder and here i stand both to impeach and purge myself condemned and myself excused then say at once what thou dost know in this i will be brief for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale romeo there dead was husband to that juliet and she there dead that romeo 's faithful wife i married them and their stol'n marriage day was tybalt 's dooms day whose untimely death banish'd the new made bridegroom from the city for whom and not for tybalt juliet pined you to remove that siege of grief from her betroth'd and would have married her perforce to county paris then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some mean to rid her from this second marriage or in my cell there would she kill herself then gave i her so tutor'd by my art a sleeping potion which so took effect as i intended for it wrought on her the form of death meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrow'd grave being the time the potion 's force should cease but he which bore my letter friar john was stay'd by accident and yesternight return'd my letter back then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindred 's vault meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo but when i came some minute ere the time of her awaking here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead she wakes and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience but then a noise did scare me from the tomb and she too desperate would not go with me but as it seems did violence on herself all this i know and to the marriage her nurse is privy and if aught in this miscarried by my fault let my old life be sacrificed some hour before his time unto the rigour of severest law we still have known thee for a holy man where 's romeo 's man what can he say in this i brought my master news of juliet 's death and then in post he came from mantua to this same place to this same monument this letter he early bid me give his father and threatened me with death going in the vault i departed not and left him there give me the letter i will look on it where is the county 's page that raised the watch sirrah what made your master in this place he came with flowers to strew his lady 's grave and bid me stand aloof and so i did anon comes one with light to ope the tomb and by and by my master drew on him and then i ran away to call the watch this letter doth make good the friar 's words their course of love the tidings of her death and here he writes that he did buy a poison of a poor pothecary and therewithal came to this vault to die and lie with juliet where be these enemies capulet montague see what a scourge is laid upon your hate that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love and i for winking at your discords too have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punish'd o brother montague give me thy hand this is my daughter 's jointure for no more can i demand but i can give thee more for i will raise her statue in pure gold that while verona by that name is known there shall no figure at such rate be set as that of true and faithful juliet as rich shall romeo 's by his lady 's lie poor sacrifices of our enmity a glooming peace this morning with it brings the sun for sorrow will not show his head go hence to have more talk of these sad things some shall be pardon'd and some punished for never was a story of more woe

that mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles in name of lendings for your highness soldiers the which he hath detain'd for lewd employments like a false traitor and injurious villain besides i say and will in battle prove or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge that ever was survey'd by english eye that all the treasons for these eighteen years complotted and contrived in this land fetch from false mowbray their first head and spring further i say and further will maintain upon his bad life to make all this good that he did plot the duke of gloucester 's death suggest his soon believing adversaries and consequently like a traitor coward sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood which blood like sacrificing abel 's cries even from the tongueless caverns of the earth to me for justice and rough chastisement and by the glorious worth of my descent this arm shall do it or this life be spent how high a pitch his resolution soars thomas of norfolk what say'st

duty in that case for you my noble lord of lancaster the honourable father to my foe once did i lay an ambush for your life a trespass that doth vex my grieved soul but ere i last received the sacrament i did confess it and exactly begg'd your grace 's pardon and i hope i had it this is my fault as for the rest appeall'd it issues from the rancour of a villain a recreant and most degenerate traitor which in myself i boldly will defend and interchangeably hurl down my gage upon this overweening traitor 's foot to prove myself a loyal gentleman even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom

enter john of gaunt with duchess alas the part i had in woodstock 's blood doth more solicit me than your exclaims to stir against the butchers of his life but since correction lieth in those hands

sharper spur hath love in thy old blood no living fire edward 's seven sons whereof thyself art one were as seven vials of his sacred blood or seven fair branches springing from one root some of those

royal root is crack'd and all the precious liquor spilt is hack'd down and his summer leaves all faded by envy 's hand and murder 's bloody axe ah gaunt his blood was thine that bed that womb that metal that self mould that fashion'd thee made him a man and though thou livest and breathest yet art thou slain in him thou dost consent in some large measure to thy father 's death in that thou seest thy wretched brother die who was the model of thy father 's life call it not patience gaunt it is despair in suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd thou showest the naked pathway to thy life teaching stern murder how to butcher thee that which in mean men we intitle patience is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts what shall i say to safeguard thine own life the best way is to venge my gloucester 's death god 's is the quarrel for god 's substitute his deputy anointed in his sight hath caused his death the which if wrongfully let heaven revenge for i may never lift an angry arm against his minister where then alas may i complain myself to god the widow 's champion and defence why then i will farewell old gaunt thou goest to coventry there to behold our cousin hereford and fell mowbray fight o sit my husband 's wrongs on hereford 's spear that it may enter butcher mowbray 's breast or if misfortune miss the first career be mowbray 's sins so heavy in his bosom they may

there lives or dies true to king richard 's throne a loyal just and upright gentleman never did captive with a freer heart cast off his chains of bondage and embrace his golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement more than my dancing soul doth celebrate this feast of battle with mine adversary most mighty liege and my companion peers take from my mouth the wish of happy years as gentle and as jocund as to jest go i to fight truth hath a quiet breast farewell my lord securely i espy virtue with valour couched in thine eye order the trial marshal and begin harry of hereford lancaster and

thomas mowbray duke of norfolk on pain to be found false and recreant both to defend himself and to approve henry of hereford lancaster and derby to god his sovereign and to him disloyal courageously and with a free desire attending but the signal to begin sound trumpets and set forward combatants a charge sounded stay the king hath thrown his warder down let them lay by their helmets and their spears and both return back to their chairs again withdraw with us and let the trumpets sound while we return these dukes what we decree a long flourish draw near and list what with our council we have done for that our kingdom 's earth should not be soil'd with that dear blood which it hath fostered and for our eyes do hate the dire aspect of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours sword and for we think the eagle winged pride of sky aspiring and ambitious thoughts with rival hating envy set on you to wake our peace which in our country 's cradle draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums with harsh resounding trumpets dreadful bray and grating shock of wrathful iron arms might from our quiet confines fright fair peace and make us wade even in our kindred 's blood therefore we banish you our territories you cousin hereford upon pain of life till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields shall not regreet our fair dominions but tread the stranger paths of banishment your will be done this must my comfort be sun that warms you here shall shine on me and those his golden beams to you here lent shall point on me and gild my banishment norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom which i with some unwillingness pronounce the sly slow hours shall not determinate the dateless limit of thy dear exile the hopeless word of never to return breathe i against thee upon pain of life a heavy sentence my most sovereign liege and all unlook'd for from your highness mouth a dearer merit not so deep a maim as to be cast forth in the common air have i deserved at your highness hands the language i have learn'd these forty years my native english now i must forego and now my tongue 's use is to me no more than an unstringed viol or a harp or like a cunning instrument cased up or being open put into his hands that knows no touch to tune the harmony within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips and dull unfeeling barren ignorance is made my gaoler to attend on me i am too old to fawn upon a nurse too far in years to be a pupil now what is thy sentence then but speechless death which robs my tongue from breathing native breath it boots thee not to be compassionate after our sentence plaining comes too late then thus i turn me from my country 's light to dwell in solemn shades of endless night return again and take an oath with thee lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands swear by the duty that you owe to god-- our part therein we banish with yourselves-- to keep the oath that we administer you never shall so help you truth and god embrace each other 's love in banishment nor never look upon each other 's face nor never write regreet nor reconcile this louring tempest of your home bred hate nor never by advised purpose meet to plot contrive or complot any ill gainst us our state our subjects or our land i swear and i to keep all this norfolk so far as to mine enemy:-- by this time had the king permitted us one of our souls had wander'd in the air banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh as now our flesh is banish'd from this land confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm since thou hast far to go bear not along the clogging burthen of a guilty soul no bolingbroke if ever i were traitor my name be blotted from the book of life and i from heaven banish'd as from hence but what thou art god thou and i do know and all too soon i fear the king shall rue farewell my liege now no way can i stray save back to england all the world 's my way exit uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes i see thy grieved heart thy sad aspect hath from the number of his banish'd years pluck'd four away to henry bolingbroke six frozen winter spent return with welcome home from banishment how long a time lies in one little word four lagging winters and four wanton springs end in a word such is the breath of kings i thank my liege that in regard of me he shortens four years of my son 's exile but little vantage shall i reap thereby for ere the six years that he hath to spend can change their moons and bring their times about my oil dried lamp and time bewasted light shall be extinct with age and endless night my inch of taper will be burnt and done and blindfold death not let me see my son why uncle thou hast many years to live but not a minute king that thou canst give shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow and pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow thou canst help time to furrow me with age but stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage thy word is current with him for my death but dead thy kingdom can not buy my breath thy son is banish'd upon good advice whereto thy tongue a party verdict gave why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour you urged me as a judge but i had rather you would have bid me argue like a father o had it been a stranger not my child to smooth his fault i should have been more mild a partial slander sought i to avoid and in the sentence my own life destroy'd alas i look'd when some of you should say i was too strict to make mine own away but you gave leave to my unwilling tongue against my will to do myself this wrong cousin farewell and uncle bid him so six years we banish him and he shall go flourish exeunt king richard ii and train cousin farewell what presence must not know from where you do remain let paper show my lord no leave take i for i will ride as far as land will let me by your side o to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words that thou return'st no greeting to thy friends i have too few to take my leave of you when the tongue 's office should be prodigal to breathe the abundant dolour of the heart thy grief is but thy absence for a time joy absent grief is present for that time what is six winters they are quickly gone to men in joy but grief makes one hour ten call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure my heart will sigh when i miscall it so which finds it an inforced pilgrimage the sullen passage of thy weary steps esteem as foil wherein thou art to set the precious jewel of thy home return nay rather every tedious stride i make will but remember me what a deal of world i wander from the jewels that i love must i not serve a long apprenticehood to foreign passages and in the end having my freedom boast of nothing else but that i was a journeyman to grief all places that the eye of heaven visits are to a wise man ports and happy havens teach thy necessity to reason thus there is no virtue like necessity think not the king did banish thee but thou the king woe doth the heavier sit where it perceives it is but faintly borne go say i sent thee forth to purchase honour and not the king exiled thee or suppose devouring pestilence hangs in our air and thou art flying to a fresher clime look what thy soul holds dear imagine it to lie that way thou go'st not whence thou comest suppose the singing birds musicians the grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd the flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more than a delightful measure or a dance for gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite the man that mocks at it and sets it light o who can hold a fire in his hand by thinking on the frosty caucasus or cloy the hungry edge of appetite by bare imagination of a feast or wallow naked in december snow by thinking on fantastic summer 's heat o no the apprehension of the good gives but the greater feeling to the worse fell sorrow 's tooth doth never rankle more than when he bites but lanceth not the sore come come my son i 'll bring thee on thy way had i thy youth and cause i would not stay then england 's ground farewell sweet soil adieu my mother and my nurse that bears me yet where'er i wander boast of this i can though banish'd yet a trueborn englishman exeunt scene iv the court enter king richard ii with bagot and green at one door and the duke of aumerle at another we did observe cousin aumerle how far brought you high hereford on his way i brought high hereford if you call him so but to the next highway and there i left him and say what store of parting tears were shed faith none for me except the north east wind which then blew bitterly against our faces awaked the sleeping rheum and so by chance did grace our hollow parting with a tear what said our cousin when you parted with him farewell and for my heart disdained that my tongue should so profane the word that taught me craft to counterfeit oppression of such grief that words seem'd buried in my sorrow 's grave marry would the word farewell have lengthen'd hours and added years to his short banishment he should have had a volume of farewells but since it would not he had none of me he is our cousin cousin but tis doubt when time shall call him home from banishment whether our kinsman come to see his friends ourself and bushy bagot here and green observed his courtship to the common people how he did seem to dive into their hearts with humble and familiar courtesy what reverence he did throw away on slaves wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles and patient underbearing of his fortune as twere to banish their affects with him off goes his bonnet to an oyster wench a brace of draymen bid god speed him well and had the tribute of his supple knee with thanks my countrymen my loving friends as were our england in reversion his and he our subjects next degree in hope well he is gone and with him go these thoughts now for the rebels which stand out in ireland expedient

spent in vain for they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain he that no more must say is listen'd more than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose more are men 's ends mark'd than their lives before the setting sun and music at the close as the last taste of sweets is sweetest last writ in remembrance more than things long past though richard my life 's counsel would not hear my death 's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear no it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds as praises of whose taste the wise are fond lascivious metres to whose venom sound the open ear of youth doth always listen report of fashions in proud italy whose manners still our tardy apish nation limps after in base imitation where doth the world thrust forth a vanity-- so it be new there 's no respect how vile-- that is not quickly buzzed into his ears then all too late comes counsel to be heard where will doth mutiny with wit 's regard direct not him whose way himself will choose tis breath thou lack'st and that breath wilt thou lose methinks i am a prophet new inspired and thus expiring do foretell of him his rash fierce blaze of riot can not last for violent fires soon burn out themselves

canterbury sir thomas erpingham sir john ramston sir john norbery sir robert waterton and francis quoint all these well furnish'd by the duke of bretagne with eight tall ships three thousand men of

cheerful disposition to please the king i did to please myself i can not do it yet i know no cause why i should welcome such a guest as grief save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest as my sweet richard yet again methinks some unborn sorrow ripe in fortune 's womb is coming towards me and my inward soul with nothing trembles at some thing it grieves more than with parting from my lord the king each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows which shows like grief itself but is not so for sorrow 's eye glazed with blinding tears divides one thing entire to many objects like perspectives which rightly gazed upon show nothing but confusion eyed awry distinguish form so your sweet majesty looking awry upon your lord 's departure find shapes of grief more than himself to wail which look'd on as it is is nought but shadows of what it is not then thrice gracious queen more than your lord 's departure weep not more 's not seen or if it be tis with false sorrow 's eye which for things true weeps things imaginary it may be so but yet my inward soul persuades me it is otherwise howe'er it be i can not but be sad so heavy sad as though on thinking on no thought i think makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady tis nothing less conceit is still derived from some forefather grief mine is not so for nothing had begot my something

for news to go to ireland but none returns for us to levy power proportionable to the enemy is all unpossible besides our nearness to the king in love is near the hate of those love not the king and that 's the wavering commons for their love lies in their purses and whoso empties them by so much fills their hearts with deadly hate wherein the king stands generally condemn'd if judgement lie in them then so do we because we ever have been near the king well i will for refuge straight to bristol castle the earl of wiltshire is already there thither will i with you for little office the

it my lord to berkeley now believe me noble lord i am a stranger here in gloucestershire these high wild hills and rough uneven ways draws out our miles and makes them wearisome and yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar making the hard way sweet and delectable but i bethink me what a weary way from ravenspurgh to cotswold will be found in ross and willoughby wanting your company which i protest hath very much beguiled the tediousness and process of my travel but theirs is sweetened with the hope to have the present benefit which i possess and hope to joy is little less in joy than hope enjoy'd by this the weary lords shall make their way seem short as mine hath done by sight of what i have your noble company of much less value is my company than your good words but who comes here enter henry percy it is my son young harry percy sent from my brother worcester whencesoever harry how fares your uncle i had thought my lord to have learn'd his health of you why is he not with the queen no my good lord he hath forsook the court broken his staff of office and dispersed the household of the king what was his reason he was not so resolved when last we spake together because your lordship was proclaimed traitor but he my lord is gone to ravenspurgh to offer service to the duke of hereford and sent me over by berkeley to discover what power the duke of york had levied there then with directions to repair to ravenspurgh have you forgot the duke of hereford boy no my good lord for that is not forgot which ne'er i did remember to my knowledge i never in my life did look on him then learn to know him now this is the duke my gracious lord i tender you my service such as it is being tender raw and young which elder days shall ripen and confirm to more approved service and desert i thank thee gentle percy and be sure i count myself in nothing else so happy as in a soul remembering my good friends and as my fortune ripens with thy love it shall be still thy true love 's recompense my heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it how far is it to berkeley and what stir keeps good old york there with his men of war there stands the castle by yon tuft of trees mann'd with three hundred men as i have heard and in it are the lords of york berkeley and seymour none else of name and noble estimate enter lord ross and lord willoughby here come the lords of ross and willoughby bloody with spurring fiery red with haste welcome my lords i wot your love pursues a banish'd traitor all my treasury is yet but unfelt thanks which more enrich'd shall be your love and labour 's recompense your presence makes us rich most noble lord and far surmounts our labour to attain it evermore thanks the exchequer of the poor which till my infant fortune comes to years stands for my bounty but who comes here enter lord berkeley it is my lord of berkeley as i guess my lord of hereford my message is to you my lord my answer is to lancaster and i am come to seek that name in england and i must find that title in your tongue before i make reply to aught you say mistake me not my lord tis not my meaning to raze one title of your honour out to you my lord i come what lord you will from the most gracious regent of this land the duke of york to know what pricks you on to take advantage of the absent time and fright our native peace with self born arms enter duke of york attended i shall not need transport my words by you here comes his grace in person my noble uncle kneels show me thy humble heart and not thy knee whose duty is deceiveable and false my gracious uncle-- tut tut grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle i am no traitor 's uncle and that word grace in an ungracious mouth is but profane why have those banish'd and forbidden legs dared once to touch a dust of england 's ground but then more why why have they dared to march so many miles upon her peaceful bosom frighting her pale faced villages with war and ostentation of despised arms comest thou because the anointed king is hence why foolish boy the king is left behind and in my loyal bosom lies his power were i but now the lord of such hot youth as when brave gaunt thy father and myself rescued the black prince that young mars of men from forth the ranks of many thousand french o then how quickly should this arm of mine now prisoner to the palsy chastise thee and minister correction to thy fault my gracious uncle let me know my fault on what condition stands it and wherein even in condition of the worst degree in gross rebellion and detested treason thou art a banish'd man and here art come before the expiration of thy time in braving arms against thy sovereign as i was banish'd i was banish'd hereford but as i come i come for lancaster and noble uncle i beseech your grace look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye you are my father for methinks in you i see old gaunt alive o then my father will you permit that i shall stand condemn'd a wandering vagabond my rights and royalties pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away to upstart unthrifts wherefore was i born if that my cousin king be king of england it must be granted i am duke of lancaster you have a son aumerle my noble cousin had you first died and he been thus trod down he should have found his uncle gaunt a father to rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay i am denied to sue my livery here and yet my letters patents give me leave my father 's goods are all distrain'd and sold and these and all are all amiss employ'd what would you have me do i am a subject and i challenge law attorneys are denied me and therefore personally i lay my claim to my inheritance of free descent the noble duke hath been too much abused it stands your grace upon to do him right base men by his endowments are made great my lords of england let me tell you this i have had feeling of my cousin 's wrongs and laboured all i could to do him right but in this kind to come in braving arms be his own carver and cut out his way to find out right with wrong it may not be and you that do abet him in this kind cherish rebellion and are rebels all the noble duke hath sworn his coming is but for his own and for the right of that we all have strongly sworn to give him aid and let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath well well i see the issue of these arms i can not mend it i must needs confess because my power is weak and all ill left but if i could by him that gave me life i would attach you all and make you stoop unto the sovereign mercy of the king but since i can not be it known to you i do remain as neuter so fare you well unless you please to enter in the castle and there repose you for this night an offer uncle that we will accept but we must win your grace to go with us to bristol castle which they say is held by bushy bagot and their complices the caterpillars of the commonwealth which i have sworn to weed and pluck away it may be i will go with you but yet

other to enjoy by rage and war these signs forerun the death or fall of kings farewell our countrymen are gone and fled as well assured richard their king is dead exit ah richard with the eyes of heavy mind i see thy glory like a shooting star fall to the base earth from the firmament thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west witnessing storms to come woe and unrest thy friends are fled to wait

charity yet to wash your blood from off my hands here in the view of men i will unfold some causes of your deaths you have misled a prince a royal king a happy gentleman in blood and lineaments by you unhappied and disfigured clean you have in manner with your sinful hours made a divorce betwixt his queen and him broke the possession of a royal bed and stain'd the beauty of a fair queen 's cheeks with tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs myself a prince by fortune of my birth near to the king in blood and near in love till you did make him misinterpret me have stoop'd my neck under your injuries and sigh'd my english breath in foreign clouds eating the bitter bread of banishment whilst you have fed upon my signories dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods from my own windows torn my household coat razed out my imprese leaving me no sign save men 's opinions and my living blood to show the world i am a gentleman this and much more much more than twice all this condemns you to the death see them deliver'd over to execution and the hand of death more welcome is the stroke of death to me than bolingbroke to england lords farewell my comfort is that heaven will take our souls and plague injustice with the pains of hell my lord northumberland see them dispatch'd exeunt northumberland and others with the prisoners uncle you say the queen is at your house for god 's sake fairly let her be entreated tell her i send to her my kind commends take special care my greetings be deliver'd a gentleman of mine i have dispatch'd with letters of your love to her at

king richard ii the bishop of carlisle duke of aumerle and soldiers barkloughly castle call they this at hand yea my lord how brooks your grace the air after your late tossing on the breaking seas needs must i like it well i weep for joy to stand upon my kingdom once again dear earth i do salute thee with my hand though rebels wound thee with their horses hoofs as a long parted mother with her child plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting so weeping smiling greet i thee my earth and do thee favours with my royal hands feed not thy sovereign 's foe my gentle earth nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense but let thy spiders that suck up thy venom and heavy gaited toads lie in their way doing annoyance to the treacherous feet which with usurping steps do trample thee yield stinging nettles to mine enemies and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower guard it i pray thee with a lurking adder whose double tongue may with a mortal touch throw death upon thy sovereign 's enemies mock not my senseless conjuration lords this earth shall have a feeling and these stones prove armed soldiers ere her native king shall falter under foul rebellion 's arms fear not my lord that power that made you king hath power to keep you king in spite of all the means that heaven yields must be embraced and not neglected else if heaven would and we will not heaven 's offer we refuse the proffer'd means of succor and redress he means my lord that we are too remiss whilst bolingbroke through our security grows strong and great in substance and in power discomfortable cousin know'st thou not that when the searching eye of heaven is hid behind the globe that lights the lower world then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen in murders and in outrage boldly here but when from under this terrestrial ball he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines and darts his light through every guilty hole then murders treasons and detested sins the cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs stand bare and naked trembling at themselves so when this thief this traitor bolingbroke who all this while hath revell'd in the night whilst we were wandering with the antipodes shall see us rising in our throne the east his treasons will sit blushing in his face not able to endure the sight of day but self affrighted tremble at his sin not all the water in the rough rude sea can wash the balm off from an anointed king the breath of worldly men can not depose the deputy elected by the lord for every man that bolingbroke hath press'd to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown god for his richard hath in heavenly pay a glorious angel then if angels fight weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right enter earl of salisbury welcome my lord \t how far off lies your power nor near nor farther off my gracious lord than this weak arm discomfort guides my tongue and bids me speak of nothing but despair one day too late i fear me noble lord hath clouded all thy happy days

welshmen hearing thou wert dead are gone to bolingbroke dispersed and fled comfort my liege why looks your grace so pale but now the blood of twenty thousand men did triumph in my face and they are fled and till so much blood thither come again have i not reason to look pale and dead all souls that will be safe fly from my side for time hath set a blot upon my pride comfort my liege remember who you are i had forgot myself am i not king awake thou coward majesty thou sleepest is not the king 's name twenty thousand names arm arm my name a puny subject strikes at thy great glory look not to the ground ye favourites of a king are we not high high be our thoughts i know my uncle york hath power enough to serve our turn but who comes here enter sir stephen scroop more health and happiness betide my liege than can my care tuned tongue deliver him mine ear is open and my heart prepared the worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold say is my kingdom lost why twas my care and what loss is it to be rid of care strives bolingbroke to be as great as we greater he shall not be if he serve god we 'll serve him too and be his fellow so revolt our subjects that we can not mend they break their faith to god as well as us cry woe destruction ruin and decay the worst is death and death will have his day glad am i that your highness is so arm'd to bear the tidings of calamity like an unseasonable stormy day which makes the silver rivers drown their shores as if the world were all dissolved to tears so high above his limits swells the rage of bolingbroke covering your fearful land with hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel white beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps against thy majesty boys with women 's voices strive to speak big and clap their female joints in stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown the very beadsmen learn to bend their bows of double fatal yew against thy state yea distaff women manage rusty bills against thy seat both young and old rebel and all goes worse than i have power to tell too well too well thou tell'st a tale so ill where is the earl of wiltshire where is bagot what is become of bushy where is green that they have let the dangerous enemy measure our confines with such peaceful steps if we prevail their heads shall pay for it i warrant they have made peace with bolingbroke peace have they made with him indeed my lord o villains vipers damn'd without redemption dogs easily won to fawn on any man snakes in my heart blood warm'd that sting my heart three judases each one thrice worse than judas would they make peace terrible hell make war upon their spotted souls for this offence sweet love i see changing his property turns to the sourest and most deadly hate again uncurse their souls their peace is made with heads and not with hands those whom you curse have felt the worst of death 's destroying wound and lie full low graved in the hollow ground is bushy green and the earl of wiltshire dead ay all of them at bristol lost their heads where is the duke my father with his power no matter where of comfort no man speak let 's talk of graves of worms and epitaphs make dust our paper and with rainy eyes write sorrow on the bosom of the earth let 's choose executors and talk of wills and yet not so for what can we bequeath save our deposed bodies to the ground our lands our lives and all are bolingbroke 's and nothing can we call our own but death and that small model of the barren earth which serves as paste and cover to our bones for god 's sake let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings how some have been deposed some slain in war some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed some poison'd by their wives some sleeping kill'd all murder'd for within the hollow crown that rounds the mortal temples of a king keeps death his court and there the antic sits scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp allowing him a breath a little scene to monarchize be fear'd and kill with looks infusing him with self and vain conceit as if this flesh which walls about our life were brass impregnable and humour'd thus comes at the last and with a little pin bores through his castle wall and farewell king cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood with solemn reverence throw away respect tradition form and ceremonious duty for you have but mistook me all this while i live with bread like you feel want taste grief need friends subjected thus how can you say to me i am a king my lord wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes but presently prevent the ways to wail to fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength gives in your weakness strength unto your foe and so your follies fight against yourself fear and be slain no worse can come to fight and fight and die is death destroying death where fearing dying pays death servile breath my father hath a power inquire of him and learn to make a body of a limb thou chidest me well proud bolingbroke i come to change blows with thee for our day of doom this ague fit of fear is over blown an easy task it is to win our own say scroop where lies our uncle with his power speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour men judge by the complexion of the sky the state and inclination of the day so may you by my dull and heavy eye my tongue hath but a heavier tale to say i play the torturer by small and small

enough beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth to duke of aumerle of that sweet way i was in to despair what say you now what comfort have we now by heaven i 'll hate him everlastingly that bids me be of comfort any more go to flint castle there i 'll pine away a king woe 's slave shall kingly woe obey that power i have discharge and let them go to ear the land that hath some hope to grow for

knees doth kiss king richard 's hand and sends allegiance and true faith of heart to his most royal person hither come even at his feet to lay my arms and power provided that my banishment repeal'd and lands restored again be freely granted if not i 'll use the advantage of my power and lay the summer 's dust with showers of blood rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd englishmen the which how far off from the mind of bolingbroke it is such crimson tempest should bedrench the fresh green lap of fair king richard 's land my stooping duty tenderly shall show go signify as much while here we march upon the grassy carpet of this plain let 's march without the noise of threatening drum that from this castle 's tatter'd battlements our fair appointments may be well perused methinks king

the eagle 's lightens forth controlling majesty alack alack for woe that any harm should stain so fair a show we are amazed and thus long have we stood to watch the fearful bending of thy knee to northumberland because we thought ourself thy lawful king and if we be how dare thy joints forget to pay their awful duty to our presence if we be not show us the hand of god that hath dismissed us from our stewardship for well we know no hand of blood and bone can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre unless he do profane steal or usurp and though you think that all as you have done have torn their souls by turning them from us and we are barren and bereft of friends yet know my master god omnipotent is mustering in his clouds on our behalf armies of pestilence and they shall strike your children yet unborn and unbegot that lift your vassal hands against my head and threat the glory of my precious crown tell bolingbroke for yond methinks he stands-- that every stride he makes upon my land is dangerous treason he is come to open the purple testament of bleeding war but ere the crown he looks for live in peace ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers sons shall ill become the flower of england 's face change the complexion of her maid pale peace to scarlet indignation and bedew her pastures grass with faithful english blood the king of heaven forbid our lord the king should so with civil and uncivil arms be rush'd upon thy thrice noble cousin harry bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand and by the honourable tomb he swears that stands upon your royal grandsire 's bones and by the royalties of both your bloods currents that spring from one most gracious head and by the buried hand of warlike gaunt and by the worth and honour of himself comprising all that may be sworn or said his coming hither hath no further scope than for his lineal royalties and to beg enfranchisement immediate on his kn ees which on thy royal party granted once his glittering arms he will commend to rust his barbed steeds to stables and his heart to faithful service of your majesty this swears he as he is a prince is just and as i am a gentleman i credit him northumberland say thus the king

windows tops threw dust and rubbish on king richard 's head then as i said the duke great bolingbroke mounted upon a hot and fiery steed which his aspiring rider seem'd to know with slow but stately pace kept on his course whilst all tongues cried god save thee bolingbroke you would have thought the very windows spake so many greedy looks of young and old through casements darted their desiring eyes upon his visage and that all the walls with painted imagery had said at once jesu preserve thee welcome bolingbroke whilst he from the one side to the other turning bareheaded lower than his proud steed 's neck bespake them thus i thank you countrymen and thus still doing thus he pass'd along alack poor richard where rode he the whilst as in a theatre the eyes of men after a well graced actor leaves the stage are idly bent on him that enters next thinking his prattle to be tedious even so or with much more contempt men 's eyes did scowl on gentle richard no man cried god save him no joyful tongue gave him his welcome home but dust was thrown upon his sacred head which with such gentle sorrow he shook off his face still combating with tears and smiles the badges of his grief and patience that had not god for some strong purpose steel'd the hearts of men they must perforce have melted and barbarism itself have pitied him but heaven hath a hand in these events to whose high

needle 's eye thoughts tending to ambition they do plot unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails may tear a passage through the flinty ribs of this hard world my ragged prison walls and for they can not die in their own pride thoughts tending to content flatter themselves that they are not the first of fortune 's slaves nor shall not be the last like silly beggars who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame that many have and others must sit there and in this thought they find a kind of ease bearing their own misfortunes on the back of such as have before endured the like thus play i in one

the heir you came not of one mother then it seems most certain of one mother mighty king that is well known and as i think one father but for the certain knowledge of that truth i put you o'er to heaven and to my mother of that i doubt as all men 's children may out on thee rude man thou dost shame thy mother and wound her honour with this diffidence i madam no i have no reason for it that is my brother 's plea and none of mine the which if he can prove a pops me out at least from fair five hundred pound a year heaven guard my mother 's honour and my land a good blunt fellow why being younger born doth he lay claim to thine inheritance i know not why except to get the land but once he slander'd me with bastardy but whether i be as true begot or no that still i lay upon my mother 's head but that i am as well begot my liege,-- fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!-- compare our faces and be judge yourself if old sir robert did beget us both and were our father and this

to treat of high affairs touching that time the advantage of his absence took the king and in the mean time sojourn'd at my father 's where how he did prevail i shame to speak but truth is truth large lengths of seas and shores between my father and my mother lay as i have heard my father speak himself when this same lusty gentleman was got upon his death bed he by will bequeath'd his lands to me and took it on his death that this my mother 's son was none of his and if he were he came into the world full fourteen weeks before the course of time then good my liege let me have what is mine my father 's land as was my father 's will sirrah your brother is legitimate your father 's wife did after wedlock bear him and if she did play false the fault was hers which fault lies on the hazards of

blood in this hot trial more than we of france rather lost more and by this hand i swear that sways the earth this climate overlooks before we will lay down our just borne arms we 'll put thee down

right in us that are our own great deputy and bear possession of our person here lord of our presence angiers and of you a greater power then we denies all this and till it be undoubted we do lock our former scruple in our strong barr'd gates king'd of our fears until our fears resolved be by some certain king purged and deposed by heaven these scroyles of angiers flout you kings and stand securely on their battlements as in a theatre whence they gape and point at your industrious scenes and acts of death your royal presences be ruled by me do like the mutines of jerusalem be friends awhile and both conjointly bend your sharpest deeds of malice on this town by east and west let france and england mount their battering cannon charged to the mouths till their soul fearing clamours have brawl'd down the flinty ribs of this contemptuous city i'ld play incessantly upon these jades even till unfenced desolation leave them as naked as the vulgar air that done dissever your united strengths and part your mingled colours once again turn face to face and bloody point to point then in a moment fortune shall cull forth out of one side her happy minion to whom in favour she shall give the day and kiss him with a glorious victory how like you this wild counsel mighty states smacks it not something of the policy now by the sky that hangs above our heads i like it well france shall we knit our powers and lay this angiers even to the ground then after fight who shall be king of it an if thou hast the mettle of a king being wronged as we are by this peevish town turn thou the mouth of thy artillery as we will ours against these saucy walls and when that we have dash'd them to the ground why then defy each other and pell mell make work upon ourselves for heaven or hell let it be so say where will you assault we from the west will send destruction into this city 's bosom i from the north our thunder from the south shall rain their drift of bullets on this town o prudent discipline from north to south austria and france shoot in each other 's mouth i 'll stir them to it come away away hear us great kings vouchsafe awhile to stay and i shall show you peace and fair faced league win you this city without stroke or wound rescue those breathing lives to die in beds that here come sacrifices for the field persever not but hear me mighty kings speak on with favour we are bent to

fairer than in blanch if zealous love should go in search of virtue where should he find it purer than in blanch if love ambitious sought a match of birth whose veins bound richer blood than lady blanch such as she is in beauty virtue birth is the young dauphin every way complete if not complete of say he is not she and she again wants nothing to name want if want it be not that she is not he

child pray that their burthens may not fall this day lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd but on this day let seamen fear no wreck no bargains break that are not this day made this day all things begun come to ill end yea faith itself to hollow falsehood change by heaven lady you shall have no cause to curse the fair proceedings of this day have i not pawn'd to you my majesty you have beguiled me with a counterfeit resembling majesty which being touch'd and tried proves valueless you are forsworn forsworn you came in arms to spill mine enemies blood but now in arms you strengthen it with yours the grappling vigour and rough frown of war is cold in amity and painted peace and our oppression hath made up this league arm arm you heavens against these perjured kings a widow cries

fortune 's champion that dost never fight but when her humorous ladyship is by to teach thee safety thou art perjured too and soothest up greatness what a fool art thou a ramping fool to brag and stamp and swear upon my party thou cold blooded slave hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side been sworn my soldier bidding me depend upon thy stars thy fortune and thy strength and dost thou now fall over to my fores thou wear a lion 's hide doff it for shame and hang a calf's skin on those recreant limbs o that a man should speak those words to me and hang a calf's skin on those recreant limbs thou darest not say so villain for thy life and hang a calf's skin on those recreant limbs we like not this thou dost forget thyself enter cardinal pandulph here comes the holy legate of the pope hail you anointed deputies of heaven to thee king john my holy errand is i pandulph of fair milan cardinal and from pope innocent the legate here do in his name religiously demand why thou against the church our holy mother so wilfully dost spurn and force perforce keep stephen langton chosen archbishop of canterbury from that holy see this in our foresaid holy father 's name pope innocent i do demand of thee what earthy name to interrogatories can task the free breath of a sacred king thou canst not cardinal devise a name so slight unworthy and ridiculous to charge me to an answer as the pope tell him this tale and from the mouth of england add thus much more that no italian priest shall tithe or toll in our dominions but as we under heaven are supreme head so under him that great supremacy where we do reign we will alone uphold without the assistance of a mortal hand so tell the pope all reverence set apart to him and his usurp'd authority brother of england you blaspheme in this though you and all the kings of christendom are led so grossly by this meddling priest dreading the curse that money may buy out and by the merit of vile gold dross dust purchase corrupted pardon of a man who in that sale sells pardon from himself though you and all the rest so grossly led this juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish yet i alone alone do me oppose against the pope and count his friends my foes then by the lawful power that i have thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate and blessed shall he be that doth revolt from his allegiance to an heretic and meritorious shall that hand be call'd canonized and worshipped as a saint that takes away by any secret course thy hateful life o lawful let it be that i have room with rome to curse awhile good father cardinal cry thou amen to my keen curses for without my wrong there is no tongue hath power to curse him right there 's law and warrant lady for my curse and for mine too when law can do no right let it be lawful that law bar no wrong law can not give my child his kingdom here for he that holds his kingdom holds the law therefore since law itself is perfect wrong how can the law forbid my tongue to curse philip of france on peril of a curse let go the hand of that arch heretic and raise the power of france upon his head unless he do submit himself to rome look'st thou pale france do not let go thy hand look to that devil lest that france repent and by disjoining hands hell lose a soul king philip listen to the cardinal and hang a calf's skin on his recreant limbs well ruffian i must pocket up these wrongs because-- your breeches best may carry them philip what say'st thou to the cardinal what should he say but as the cardinal bethink you father for the difference is purchase of a heavy curse from rome or the light loss of england for a friend forego the easier that 's the curse of rome o lewis stand fast the devil tempts thee here in likeness of a new untrimmed bride the lady constance speaks not from her faith but from her need o if thou grant my need which only lives but by the death of faith that need must needs infer this principle that faith would live again by death of need o then tread down my need and faith mounts up keep my need up and faith is trodden down the king is moved and answers not to this o be removed from him and answer well do so king philip hang no more in doubt hang nothing but a calf's skin most sweet lout i am perplex'd and know not what to say what canst thou say but will perplex thee more if thou stand excommunicate and cursed good reverend father make my person yours and tell me how you would bestow yourself this royal hand and mine are newly knit and the conjunction of our inward souls married in league coupled and linked together with all religious strength of sacred vows the latest breath that gave the sound of words was deep sworn faith peace amity true love between our kingdoms and our royal selves and even before this truce but new before no longer than we well could wash our hands to clap this royal bargain up of peace heaven knows they were besmear'd and over stain'd with slaughter 's pencil where revenge did paint the fearful difference of incensed kings and shall these hands so lately purged of blood so newly join'd in love so strong in both unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet play fast and loose with faith so jest with heaven make such unconstant children of ourselves as now again to snatch our palm from palm unswear faith sworn and on the marriage bed of smiling peace to march a bloody host and make a riot on the gentle brow of true sincerity o holy sir my reverend father let it not be so out of your grace devise ordain impose some gentle order and then we shall be blest to do your pleasure and continue friends all form is formless order orderless save what is opposite to england 's love therefore to arms be champion of our church or let the church our mother breathe her curse a mother 's curse on her revolting son france thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue a chafed lion by the mortal paw a fasting tiger safer by the tooth than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold i may disjoin my hand but not my faith so makest thou faith an enemy to faith and like a civil war set'st oath to oath thy tongue against thy tongue o let thy vow first made to heaven first be to heaven perform'd that is to be the champion of our church what since thou sworest is sworn against thyself and may not be performed by thyself for that which thou hast sworn to do amiss is not amiss when it is truly done and being not done where doing tends to ill the truth is then most done not doing it the better act of purposes mistook is to mistake again though indirect yet indirection thereby grows direct and falsehood falsehood cures as fire cools fire within the scorched veins of one new burn'd it is religion that doth make vows kept but thou hast sworn against religion by what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st and makest an oath the surety for thy truth against an oath the truth thou art unsure to swear swears only not to be forsworn else what a mockery should it be to swear but thou dost swear only to be forsworn and most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear therefore thy later vows against thy first is in thyself rebellion to thyself and better conquest never canst thou make than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts against these giddy loose suggestions upon which better part our prayers come in if thou vouchsafe them but if not then know the peril of our curses light on thee so heavy as thou shalt not shake them off but in despair die under their black weight rebellion flat rebellion will't not be will not a calfs skin stop that mouth of thine father to arms upon thy wedding day against the blood that thou hast married what shall our feast be kept with slaughter'd men shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums clamours of hell be measures to our pomp o husband hear me ay alack how new is husband in my mouth even for that name which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce upon my knee i beg go not to arms against mine uncle o upon my knee made hard with kneeling i do pray to thee thou virtuous dauphin alter not the doom forethought by heaven now shall i see thy love what motive may be stronger with thee than the name of wife that which upholdeth him that thee upholds his honour o thine honour lewis thine honour i muse your majesty doth seem so cold when such profound respects do pull you on i will denounce a curse upon his head thou shalt not need england i will fall from thee o fair return of banish'd majesty o foul revolt of french inconstancy france thou shalt rue this hour within this hour old time the clock setter that bald sexton time is it as he will well then france shall rue the sun 's o'ercast with blood fair day adieu which is the side that i must go withal i am with both each army hath a hand and in their rage i having hold of both they swirl asunder and dismember me husband i can not pray that thou mayst win uncle i needs must pray that thou mayst lose father i may not wish the

thee good i had a thing to say but let it go the sun is in the heaven and the proud day attended with the pleasures of the world is all too wanton and too full of gawds to give me audience if the midnight bell did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth sound on into the drowsy race of night if this same were a churchyard where we stand and thou possessed with a thousand wrongs or if that surly spirit melancholy had baked thy blood and made it heavy thick which else runs tickling up and down the veins making that idiot laughter keep men 's eyes and strain their cheeks to idle merriment a passion hateful to my purposes or if that thou couldst see me without eyes hear me without thine ears and make reply without a tongue using conceit alone without eyes ears and harmful sound of words then in despite of brooded watchful day i would into thy bosom pour my thoughts but ah i will not yet i love thee well and by my troth i think thou lovest me well so well that what you bid me undertake though that my death were adjunct to my act by heaven i would do it do not i know thou wouldst good hubert hubert hubert throw thine eye on yon young boy i 'll tell thee what my friend he is

that hath he fortified so hot a speed with such advice disposed such temperate order in so fierce a cause doth want example who hath read or heard of any kindred action like to this well could i bear that england had this praise so we could find some pattern of our shame enter constance look who comes here a grave unto a soul holding the eternal spirit against her will in the vile prison of afflicted breath i prithee lady go away with me lo now i now see the issue of your peace patience good lady comfort gentle constance no i defy all counsel all redress but that which ends all counsel true redress death death o amiable lovely death thou odouriferous stench sound rottenness arise forth from the couch of lasting night thou hate and terror to prosperity and i will kiss thy detestable bones and put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows and ring these fingers with thy household worms and stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust and be a carrion monster like thyself come grin on me and i will think thou smilest and buss thee as thy wife misery 's love o come to me o fair affliction peace no no i will not having breath to cry o that my tongue were in the thunder 's mouth then with a passion would i shake the world and rouse from sleep that fell anatomy which can not hear a lady 's feeble voice which scorns a modern invocation lady you utter madness and not sorrow thou art not holy to belie me so i am not mad this hair i tear is mine my name is constance i was geffrey 's wife young arthur is my son and he is lost i am not mad i would to heaven i were for then tis like i should forget myself o if i could what grief should i forget preach some philosophy to make me mad and thou shalt be canonized cardinal for being not mad but sensible of grief my reasonable part produces reason how i may be deliver'd of these woes and teaches me to kill or hang myself if i were mad i should forget my son or madly think a babe of clouts were he i am not mad too well too well i feel the different plague of each calamity bind up those tresses o what love i note in the fair multitude of those her hairs where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends do glue themselves in sociable grief like true inseparable faithful loves sticking together in calamity to england if you will bind up your hairs yes that i will and wherefore will i do it i tore them from their bonds and cried aloud o that these hands could so redeem my son as they have given these hairs their liberty but now i envy at their liberty and will again commit them to their bonds because my poor child is a prisoner and father cardinal i have heard you say that we shall see and know our friends in heaven if that be true i shall see my boy again for since the birth of cain the first male child to him that did but yesterday suspire there was not such a gracious creature born but now will canker sorrow eat my bud and chase the native beauty from his cheek and he will look as hollow as a ghost as dim and meagre as an ague 's fit and so he 'll die and rising so again when i shall meet him in the court of heaven i shall not know him therefore never never must i behold my pretty arthur more you hold too heinous a respect of grief he talks to me that never had a son you are as fond of grief as of your child grief fills the room up of my absent child lies in his bed walks up and down with me puts on his pretty looks repeats his words remembers me of all his gracious parts stuffs out his vacant garments with his form then have i reason to be fond of grief fare you well had you such a loss as i i could give better comfort than you do i will not keep this form upon my head when there is such disorder in my wit o lord my boy my arthur my fair son my life my joy my food my all the world my widow comfort and my sorrows cure exit i fear some outrage and i 'll follow her exit there 's nothing in this world can make me joy life is as tedious as a twice told tale vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man and bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world 's taste that it yields nought but shame and bitterness before the curing of a strong disease even in the instant of repair and health the fit is strongest evils that take leave on their departure most of all show evil what have you lost by losing of this day all days of glory joy and happiness if you had won it certainly you had no no when fortune means to men most good she looks upon them with a threatening eye tis strange to think how much king john hath lost in this which he accounts so clearly won are not you grieved that arthur is his prisoner as heartily as he is glad he hath him your mind is all as youthful as your blood now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit for even the breath of what i mean to speak shall blow each dust each straw each little rub out of the path which shall directly lead thy foot to england 's throne and therefore mark john hath seized arthur and it can not be that whiles warm life plays in that infant 's veins the misplaced john should entertain an hour one minute nay one quiet breath of rest a sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd and he that stands upon a slippery place makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up that john may stand then arthur needs must fall so be it for it can not be but so but what shall i gain by young arthur 's fall you in the right of lady blanch your wife may then make all the claim that arthur did and lose it life and all as arthur did how green you are and fresh in this old world john lays you plots the times conspire with you for he that steeps his safety in true blood shall find but bloody safety and untrue this act so evilly born shall cool the hearts of all his people and freeze up their zeal that none so small advantage shall step forth to cheque his reign but they will cherish it no natural exhalation in the sky no scope of nature no distemper'd day no common wind no customed event but they will pluck away his natural cause and call them meteors prodigies and signs abortives presages and tongues of heaven plainly denouncing vengeance upon john may be he will not touch young arthur 's life but hold himself safe in his prisonment o sir when he shall hear of your approach if that young arthur be not gone already even at that news he dies and then the hearts of all his people shall revolt from him and kiss the lips of unacquainted change and pick strong matter of revolt and wrath out of the bloody fingers ends of john methinks i see this hurly all on foot and o what better matter breeds for you than i have named the bastard faulconbridge is now in england ransacking the church offending charity if but a dozen french were there in arms they would be as a call to train ten thousand english to their side or as a little snow tumbled about anon becomes a mountain o noble dauphin go with me to the king tis wonderful what may be wrought out of their discontent now that their souls are topful of offence for england go i will whet on the king strong reasons make strong actions let us go if you say ay the king will not say no exeunt act iv scene i. a room in a castle enter hubert and executioners heat me these irons hot and look thou stand within the arras when i strike my foot upon the bosom of the ground rush forth and

lad come forth i have to say with you enter arthur good morrow hubert good morrow little prince as little prince having so great a title to be more prince as may be you are sad indeed i have been merrier mercy on me methinks no body should be sad but i yet i remember when i was in france young gentlemen would be as sad as night only for wantonness by my christendom so i were out of prison and kept sheep i should be as merry as the day is long and so i would be here but that i doubt my uncle practises more harm to me he is afraid of me and i of him is it my fault that i was geffrey 's son no indeed is't not and i would to heaven i were your son so you would love me hubert aside   if i talk to him with his innocent prate he will awake my mercy which lies dead therefore i will be sudden and dispatch are you sick hubert you look pale to day in sooth i would you were a little sick that i might sit all night and watch with you i warrant i love you more than you do me aside   his words do take possession of my bosom read here young arthur showing a paper aside how now foolish rheum turning dispiteous torture out of door i must be brief lest resolution drop out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears can you not read it is it not fair writ too fairly hubert for so foul effect must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes young boy i must and will you and i will have you the heart when your head did but ache i knit my handercher about your brows the best i had a princess wrought it me and i did never ask it you again and with my hand at midnight held your head and like the watchful minutes to the hour still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time saying what lack you and where lies your grief or what good love may i perform for you many a poor man 's son would have lien still and ne'er have spoke a loving word to you but you at your sick service had a prince nay you may think my love was crafty love and call it cunning do an if you will if heaven be pleased that you must use me ill why then you must will you put out mine eyes these eyes that never did nor never shall so much as frown on you i have sworn to do it and with hot irons must i burn them out ah none but in this iron age would do it the iron of itself though heat red hot approaching near these eyes would drink my tears and quench his fiery indignation even in the matter of mine innocence nay after that consume away in rust but for containing fire to harm mine eye are you more stubborn hard than hammer'd iron an if an angel should have come to me and told me hubert should put out mine eyes i would not have believed him,--no tongue but hubert 's come forth stamps re enter executioners with a cord irons   and c do as i bid you do o save me hubert save me my eyes are out even with the fierce looks of these bloody men give me the iron i say and bind him here alas what need you be so boisterous rough i will not struggle i will stand stone still for heaven sake hubert let me not be bound nay hear me hubert drive these men away and i will sit as quiet as a lamb i will not stir nor wince nor speak a word nor look upon the iron angerly thrust but these men away and i 'll forgive you whatever torment you do put me to go stand within let me alone with him i am best pleased to be from such a deed exeunt executioners alas i then have chid away my friend he hath a stern look but a gentle heart let him come back that his compassion may give life to yours come boy prepare yourself is there no remedy none but to lose your eyes o heaven that there were but a mote in yours a grain a dust a gnat a wandering hair any annoyance in that precious sense then feeling what small things are boisterous there your vile intent must needs seem horrible is this your promise go to hold your tongue hubert the utterance of a brace of tongues must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes let me not hold my tongue let me not hubert or hubert if you will cut out my tongue so i may keep mine eyes o spare mine eyes though to no use but still to look on you lo by my truth the instrument is cold and would not harm me i can heat it boy no in good sooth the fire is dead with grief being create for comfort to be used in undeserved extremes see else yourself there is no malice in this burning coal the breath of heaven has blown his spirit out and strew'd repentent ashes on his head but with my breath i can revive it boy an if you do you will but make it blush and glow with shame of your proceedings hubert nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes and like a dog that is compell'd to fight snatch at his master that doth tarre him on all things that you should use to do me wrong deny their office only you do lack that mercy which fierce fire and iron extends creatures of note for mercy lacking uses well see to live i will not touch thine eye for all the treasure that thine uncle owes yet am i sworn and i did purpose boy with this same very iron to burn them out o now you look like hubert all this while you were disguised peace no more adieu your uncle must not know but you are dead i 'll fill these dogged spies with false reports and pretty child sleep doubtless and secure that hubert for the wealth of all the world will not offend thee o heaven i thank you hubert silence no more go closely in with me much danger do i undergo for thee exeunt scene ii king john 's palace enter king john pembroke salisbury and other lords here once again we sit once again crown'd and looked upon i hope with cheerful eyes this once again but that your highness pleased was once superfluous you were crown'd before and that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off the faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt fresh expectation troubled not the land with any long'd for change or better state therefore to be possess'd with double pomp to guard a title that was rich before to gild refined gold to paint the lily to throw a perfume on the violet to smooth the ice or add another hue unto the rainbow or with taper light to seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish is wasteful and ridiculous excess but that your royal pleasure must be done this act is as an ancient tale new told and in the last repeating troublesome being urged at a time unseasonable in this the antique and well noted face of plain old form is much disfigured and like a shifted wind unto a sail it makes the course of thoughts to fetch about startles and frights consideration makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected for putting on so new a fashion'd robe when workmen strive to do better than well they do confound their skill in covetousness and oftentimes excusing of a fault doth make the fault the worse by the excuse as patches set upon a little breach discredit more in hiding of the fault than did the fault before it was so patch'd to this effect before you were new crown'd we breathed our counsel but it pleased your highness to overbear it and we are all well pleased since all and every part of what we would doth make a stand at what your highness will some reasons of this double coronation i have possess'd you with and think them strong and more more strong then lesser is my fear i shall indue you with meantime but ask what you would have reform'd that is not well and well shall you perceive how willingly i will both hear and grant you your requests then i as one that am the tongue of these to sound the purpose of all their hearts both for myself and them but chief of all your safety for the which myself and them bend their best studies heartily request the enfranchisement of arthur whose restraint doth move the murmuring lips of discontent to break into this dangerous argument,-- if what in rest you have in right you hold why then your fears which as they say attend the steps of wrong should move you to mew up your tender kinsman and to choke his days with barbarous ignorance and deny his youth the rich advantage of good exercise that the time 's enemies may not have this to grace occasions let it be our suit that you have bid us ask his liberty which for our goods we do no further ask than whereupon our weal on you depending counts it your weal he have his liberty enter hubert let it be so i do commit his youth to your direction hubert what news with you taking him apart this is the man should do the bloody deed he show'd his warrant to a friend of mine the image of a wicked heinous fault lives in his eye that close aspect of his does show the mood of a much troubled breast and i do fearfully believe tis done what we so fear'd he had a charge to do the colour of the king doth come and go between his purpose and his conscience like heralds twixt two dreadful battles set his passion is so ripe it needs must break and when it breaks i fear will issue thence the foul corruption of a sweet child 's death we can not hold mortality 's strong hand good lords although my will to give is living the suit which you demand is gone and dead he tells us arthur is deceased to night indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure indeed we heard how near his death he was before the child himself felt he was sick this must be answer'd either here or hence why do you bend such solemn brows on me think you i bear the shears of destiny have i commandment on the pulse of life it is apparent foul play and tis shame that greatness should so grossly offer it so thrive it in your game and so farewell stay yet lord salisbury i 'll go with thee and find the inheritance of this poor child his little kingdom of a forced grave that blood which owed the breadth of all this isle three foot of it doth hold bad world the while this must not be thus borne this will break out to all our sorrows and ere long i doubt exeunt lords they burn in indignation i repent there is no sure foundation set on blood no certain life achieved by others death enter a messenger a fearful eye thou hast where is that blood that i have seen inhabit in those cheeks so foul a sky clears not without a storm pour down thy weather how goes all in france from france to england never such a power for any foreign preparation was levied in the body of a land the copy of your speed is learn'd by them for when you should be told they do prepare the tidings come that they are all arrived o where hath our intelligence been drunk where hath it slept where is my mother 's care that such an army could be drawn in france and she not hear of it my liege her ear is stopp'd with dust the first of april died your noble mother and as i hear my lord the lady constance in a frenzy died three days before but this from rumour 's tongue i idly heard if true or false i know not withhold thy speed dreadful occasion o make a league with me till i have pleased my discontented peers what mother dead how wildly then walks my estate in france under whose conduct came those powers of france that thou for truth givest out are landed here under the dauphin thou hast made me giddy with these ill tidings enter the bastard and peter of pomfret now what says the world to your proceedings do not seek to stuff my head with more ill news for it is full but if you be afeard to hear the worst then let the worst unheard fall on your bead bear with me cousin for i was amazed under the tide but now i breathe again aloft the flood and can give audience to any tongue speak it of what it will how i have sped among the clergymen the sums i have collected shall express but as i travell'd hither through the land i find the people strangely fantasied possess'd with rumours full of idle dreams not knowing what they fear but full of fear and here a prophet that i brought with me from forth the streets of pomfret whom i found with many hundreds treading on his heels to whom he sung in rude harsh sounding rhymes that ere the next ascension day at noon your highness should deliver up your crown thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so foreknowing that the truth will fall out so hubert away with him imprison him and on that day at noon whereon he says i shall yield up my crown let him be hang'd deliver him to safety and return for i must use thee exeunt hubert with peter o my gentle cousin hear'st thou the news abroad who are arrived the french my lord men 's mouths are full of it besides i met lord bigot and lord salisbury with eyes as red as new enkindled fire and others more going to seek the grave of arthur who they say is kill'd to night on your suggestion gentle kinsman go and thrust thyself into their companies i have a way to win their loves again bring them before me i will seek them out nay but make haste the better foot before o let me have no subject enemies when adverse foreigners affright my towns with dreadful pomp of stout invasion be mercury set feathers to thy heels and fly like thought from them to me again the spirit of the time shall teach me speed exit spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman go after him for he perhaps shall need some messenger betwixt me and the peers and be thou he with all my heart my liege exit my mother dead re enter hubert my lord they say five moons were seen to night four fixed and the fifth did whirl about the other four in wondrous motion five moons old men and beldams in the streets do prophesy upon it dangerously young arthur 's death is common in their mouths and when they talk of him they shake their heads and whisper one another in the ear and he that speaks doth gripe the hearer 's wrist whilst he that hears makes fearful action with wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes i saw a smith stand with his hammer thus the whilst his iron did on the anvil cool with open mouth swallowing a tailor 's news who with his shears and measure in his hand standing on slippers which his nimble haste had falsely thrust upon contrary feet told of a many thousand warlike french that were embattailed and rank'd in kent another lean unwash'd artificer cuts off his tale and talks of arthur 's death why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears why urgest thou so oft young arthur 's death thy hand hath murder'd him i had a mighty cause to wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him no had my lord why did you not provoke me it is the curse of kings to be attended by slaves that take their humours for a warrant to break within the bloody house of life and on the winking of authority to understand a law to know the meaning of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns more upon humour than advised respect here is your hand and seal for what i did o when the last account twixt heaven and earth is to be made then shall this hand and seal witness against us to damnation how oft the sight of means to do ill deeds make deeds ill done hadst not thou been by a fellow by the hand of nature mark'd quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame this murder had not come into my mind but taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect finding thee fit for bloody villany apt liable to be employ'd in danger i faintly broke with thee of arthur 's death and thou to be endeared to a king made it no conscience to destroy a prince my lord-- hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause when i spake darkly what i purposed or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face as bid me tell my tale in express words deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off and those thy fears might have wrought fears in me but thou didst understand me by my signs and didst in signs again parley with sin yea without stop didst let thy heart consent and consequently thy rude hand to act the deed which both our tongues held vile to name out of my sight and never see me more my nobles leave me and my state is braved even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers nay in the body of this fleshly land this kingdom this confine of blood and breath hostility and civil tumult reigns between my conscience and my cousin 's death arm you against your other enemies i 'll make a peace between your soul and you young arthur is alive this hand of mine is yet a maiden and an innocent hand not painted with the crimson spots of blood within this bosom never enter'd yet the dreadful motion of a murderous thought and you have slander'd nature in my form which howsoever rude exteriorly is yet the cover of a fairer mind than to be butcher of an innocent child doth arthur live o haste thee to the peers throw this report on their incensed rage and make them tame to their obedience forgive the comment that my passion made upon thy feature for my rage was blind and foul imaginary eyes of blood presented thee more hideous than thou art o answer not but to my closet bring the angry lords with all expedient haste i conjure thee but slowly run more fast exeunt scene iii before the castle enter arthur on the walls the wall is high and yet will i leap down good ground be pitiful and hurt me not there 's few or none do know me if they did this ship boy 's semblance hath disguised me quite i am afraid and yet i 'll venture it if i get down and do not break my limbs i 'll find a thousand shifts to get away as good to die and go as die and stay leaps down o me my uncle 's spirit is in these stones heaven take my soul and england keep my bones dies enter pembroke salisbury and bigot lords i will meet him at saint edmundsbury it is our safety and we must embrace this gentle offer of the perilous time who brought that letter from the cardinal the count melun a noble lord of france whose private with me of the dauphin 's love is much more general than these lines import to morrow morning let us meet him then or rather then set forward for twill be two long days journey lords or ere we meet enter the bastard once more to day well met distemper'd lords the king by me requests your presence straight the king hath dispossess'd himself of us we will not line his thin bestained cloak with our pure honours nor attend the foot that leaves the print of blood where'er it walks return and tell him so we know the worst whate'er you think good words i think were best our griefs and not our manners reason now but there is little reason in your grief therefore twere reason you had manners now sir sir impatience hath his privilege tis true to hurt his master no man else this is the prison what is he lies here seeing arthur o death made proud with pure and princely beauty the earth had not a hole to hide this deed murder as hating what himself hath done doth lay it open to urge on revenge or when he doom'd this beauty to a grave found it too precious princely for a grave sir richard what think you have you beheld or have you read or heard or could you think or do you almost think although you see that you do see could thought without this object form such another this is the very top the height the crest or crest unto the crest of murder 's arms this is the bloodiest shame the wildest savagery the vilest stroke that ever wall eyed wrath or staring rage presented to the tears of soft remorse all murders past do stand excused in this and this so sole and so unmatchable shall give a holiness a purity to the yet unbegotten sin of times and prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest exampled by this heinous spectacle it is a damned and a bloody work the graceless action of a heavy hand if that it be the work of any hand if that it be the work of any hand we had a kind of light what would ensue it is the shameful work of hubert 's hand the practise and the purpose of the king from whose obedience i forbid my soul kneeling before this ruin of sweet life and breathing to his breathless excellence the incense of a vow a holy vow never to taste the pleasures of the world never to be infected with delight nor conversant with ease and idleness till i have set a glory to this hand by giving it the worship of revenge our souls religiously confirm thy words enter hubert lords i am hot with haste in seeking you arthur doth live the king hath sent for you o he is old and blushes not at death avaunt thou hateful villain get thee gone i am no villain must i rob the law drawing his sword your sword is bright sir put it up again not till i sheathe it in a murderer 's skin stand back lord salisbury stand back i say by heaven i think my sword 's as sharp as yours i would not have you lord forget yourself nor tempt the danger of my true defence lest i by marking of your rage forget your worth your greatness and nobility out dunghill darest thou brave a nobleman not for my life but yet i dare defend my innocent life against an emperor thou art a murderer do not prove me so yet i am none whose tongue soe'er speaks false not truly speaks who speaks not truly lies cut him to pieces keep the peace i say stand by or i shall gall you faulconbridge thou wert better gall the devil salisbury if thou but frown on me or stir thy foot or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame i 'll strike thee dead put up thy sword betime or i 'll so maul you and your toasting iron that you shall think the devil is come from hell what wilt thou do renowned faulconbridge second a villain and a murderer lord bigot i am none who kill'd this prince tis not an hour since i left him well i honour'd him i loved him and will weep my date of life out for his sweet life 's loss trust not those cunning waters of his eyes for villany is not without such rheum and he long traded in it makes it seem like rivers of remorse and innocency away with me all you whose souls abhor the uncleanly savours of a slaughter house for i am stifled with this smell of sin away toward bury to the dauphin there there tell the king he may inquire us out exeunt lords here 's a good world knew you of this fair work beyond the infinite and boundless reach of mercy if thou didst this deed of death art thou damn'd hubert do but hear me sir ha i 'll tell thee what thou'rt damn'd as black nay nothing is so black thou art more deep damn'd than prince lucifer there is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell as thou shalt be if thou didst kill this child upon my soul-- if thou didst but consent to this most cruel act do but despair and if thou want'st a cord the smallest thread that ever spider twisted from her womb will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam to hang thee on or wouldst thou drown thyself put but a little water in a spoon and it shall be as all the ocean enough to stifle such a villain up i do suspect thee very grievously if i in act consent or sin of thought be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath which was embounded in this beauteous clay let hell want pains enough to torture me i left him well go bear him in thine arms i am amazed methinks and lose my way among the thorns and dangers of this world how easy dost thou take all england up from forth this morsel of dead royalty the life the right and truth of all this realm is fled to heaven and england now is left to tug and scamble and to part by the teeth the unowed interest of proud swelling state now for the bare pick'd bone of majesty doth dogged war bristle his angry crest and snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace now powers from home and discontents at home meet in one line and vast confusion waits as doth a raven on a sick fall'n beast the imminent decay of wrested pomp now happy he whose cloak and cincture can hold out this tempest bear away that child and follow me with speed i 'll to the king a thousand businesses are brief in hand and heaven itself doth frown upon the land exeunt act v scene i. king john 's palace enter king john cardinal pandulph and attendants thus have i yielded up into your hand

all your power to stop their marches fore we are inflamed our discontented counties do revolt our people quarrel with obedience swearing allegiance and the love of soul to stranger blood to foreign royalty this inundation of mistemper'd humour rests by you only to be qualified then pause not for the present time 's so sick that present medicine must be minister'd or overthrow incurable ensues it was my breath that blew this tempest up upon your stubborn usage of the pope but since you are a gentle convertite my tongue shall hush again this storm of war and make fair weather in your blustering land on this ascension day remember well upon your oath of service to the pope go i to make the french lay down their arms exit is this ascension day did not the prophet say that before ascension day at noon my crown i should give off even so i have i did suppose it should be on constraint but heaven be thank'd it is but voluntary enter the bastard all kent hath yielded nothing there holds out but dover castle london hath received like a kind host the dauphin and his powers your nobles will not hear you but are gone to offer service to your enemy and wild amazement hurries up and down the little number of your doubtful friends would not my lords return to me again after they heard young arthur was alive they found him dead and cast into the streets an empty casket where the jewel of life by some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away that villain hubert told me he did live so on my soul he did for aught he knew but wherefore do you droop why look you sad be great in act as you have been in thought let not the world see fear and sad distrust govern the motion of a kingly eye be stirring as the time be fire with fire threaten the threatener and outface the brow of bragging horror so shall inferior eyes that borrow their behaviors from the great grow great by your example and put on the dauntless spirit of resolution away and glister like the god of war when he intendeth to become the field show boldness and aspiring confidence what shall they seek the lion in his den and fright him there and make him tremble there o let it not be said forage and run to meet displeasure farther from the doors and grapple with him ere he comes so nigh the legate of the pope hath been with me and i have made a happy peace with him and he hath promised to dismiss the powers led by the dauphin o inglorious league shall we upon the footing of our land send fair play orders and make compromise insinuation parley and base truce to arms invasive shall a beardless boy a cocker'd silken wanton brave our fields and flesh his spirit in a warlike soil mocking the air with colours idly spread and find no cheque let us my liege to arms perchance the cardinal can not make your peace or if he do let it at least be said they saw we had a purpose of defence have thou the ordering of this present time away then with good courage yet i know our party may well meet a prouder foe exeunt scene ii lewis 's camp at st edmundsbury enter in arms lewis salisbury melun pembroke bigot and soldiers my lord melun let this be copied out and keep it safe for our remembrance return the precedent to these lords again that having our fair order written down both they and we perusing o'er these notes may know wherefore we took the sacrament and keep our faiths firm and inviolable upon our sides it never shall be broken and noble dauphin albeit we swear a voluntary zeal and an unurged faith to your proceedings yet believe me prince i am not glad that such a sore of time should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt and heal the inveterate canker of one wound by making many o it grieves my soul that i must draw this metal from my side to be a widow maker o and there where honourable rescue and defence cries out upon the name of salisbury but such is the infection of the time that for the health and physic of our right we can not deal but with the very hand of stern injustice and confused wrong and is't not pity o my grieved friends that we the sons and children of this isle were born to see so sad an hour as this wherein we step after a stranger march upon her gentle bosom and fill up her enemies ranks,--i must withdraw and weep upon the spot of this enforced cause,-- to grace the gentry of a land remote and follow unacquainted colours here what here o nation that thou couldst remove that neptune 's arms who clippeth thee about would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself and grapple thee unto a pagan shore where these two christian armies might combine the blood of malice in a vein of league and not to spend it so unneighbourly a noble temper dost thou show in this and great affections wrestling in thy bosom doth make an earthquake of nobility o what a noble combat hast thou fought between compulsion and a brave respect let me wipe off this honourable dew that silverly doth progress on thy cheeks my heart hath melted at a lady 's tears being an ordinary inundation but this effusion of such manly drops this shower blown up by tempest of the soul startles mine eyes and makes me more amazed than had i seen the vaulty top of heaven figured quite o'er with burning meteors lift up thy brow renowned salisbury and with a great heart heave away the storm commend these waters to those baby eyes that never saw the giant world enraged nor met with fortune other than at feasts full of warm blood of mirth of gossiping come come for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep into the purse of rich prosperity as lewis himself so nobles shall you all that knit your sinews to the strength of mine and even there methinks an angel spake enter cardinal pandulph look where the holy legate comes apace to give us warrant from the hand of heaven and on our actions set the name of right with holy breath hail noble prince of france the next is this king john hath reconciled himself to rome his spirit is come in that so stood out against the holy church the great metropolis and see of rome therefore thy threatening colours now wind up and tame the savage spirit of wild war that like a lion foster'd up at hand it may lie gently at the foot of peace and be no further harmful than in show your grace shall pardon me i will not back i am too high born to be propertied to be a secondary at control or useful serving man and instrument to any sovereign state throughout the world your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars between this chastised kingdom and myself and brought in matter that should feed this fire and now tis far too huge to be blown out with that same weak wind which enkindled it you taught me how to know the face of right acquainted me with interest to this land yea thrust this enterprise into my heart and come ye now to tell me john hath made his peace with rome what is that peace to me i by the honour of my marriage bed after young arthur claim this land for mine and now it is half conquer'd must i back because that john hath made his peace with rome am i rome 's slave what penny hath rome borne what men provided what munition sent to underprop this action is't not i that undergo this charge who else but i and such as to my claim are liable sweat in this business and maintain this war have i not heard these islanders shout out vive le roi as i have bank'd their towns have i not here the best cards for the game to win this easy match play'd for a crown and shall i now give o'er the yielded set no no on my soul it never shall be said you look but on the outside of this work outside or inside i will not return

lord of milan from the king i come to learn how you have dealt for him and as you answer i do know the scope and warrant limited unto my tongue the dauphin is too wilful opposite and will not temporize with my entreaties he flatly says he 'll not lay down his arms by all the blood that ever fury breathed the youth says well now hear our english king for thus his royalty doth speak in me he is prepared and reason too he should this apish and unmannerly approach this harness'd masque and unadvised revel this unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops the king doth smile at and is well prepared to whip this dwarfish war these pigmy arms from out the circle of his territories that hand which had the strength even at your door to cudgel you and make you take the hatch to dive like buckets in concealed wells to crouch in litter of your stable planks to lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks to hug with swine to seek sweet safety out in vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake even at the crying of your nation 's crow thinking his voice an armed englishman shall that victorious hand be feebled here that in your chambers gave you chastisement no know the gallant monarch is in

it is said mark antony 's was by caesar he chid the sisters when first they put the name of king upon me and bade them speak to him then prophet like they hail'd him father to a line of kings upon my head they placed a fruitless crown and put a barren sceptre in my gripe thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand no son of mine succeeding if t be so for banquo 's issue have i filed my mind for

half a soul and to a notion crazed say thus did banquo you made it known to us i did so and went further which is now our point of second meeting do you find your patience so predominant in your nature that you can let this go are you so gospell'd to pray for this good man and for his issue whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave and beggar'd yours for ever we are men my liege ay in the catalogue ye go for men as hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs shoughs water rugs and demi wolves are clept all by the name of dogs the valued file distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle

such bloody distance that every minute of his being thrusts against my near'st of life and though i could with barefaced power sweep him from my sight and bid my will avouch it yet i must not for certain friends that are both his and mine whose loves i may not drop but wail his fall who i myself struck down and thence it is that i to your assistance do make love masking the business from the

donalbain to kill their gracious father damned fact how it did grieve macbeth did he not straight in pious rage the two delinquents tear that were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep was not that nobly done ay and wisely too for twould have anger'd any heart alive to hear the men deny't so that i say he has borne all things well and i do think that had he duncan 's sons under his key-- as an't please heaven he shall not they should find what twere to kill a father so should fleance but peace for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd his presence at the tyrant 's feast i hear macduff lives in disgrace sir can you tell where he bestows himself the son of duncan from whom this tyrant holds the due of birth lives in the english court and is received of the most pious edward with such grace that the malevolence of fortune nothing takes from his high respect thither macduff is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid to wake northumberland and warlike siward that by the help of these with him above to ratify the work we may again give to our tables meat sleep to our nights free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives do faithful homage and receive free honours all which we pine for now and this report hath so exasperate the king that he prepares for some attempt of war sent he to macduff he did and with an absolute sir not i the cloudy messenger turns me his back and hums as who should say you 'll rue the time that clogs me with this answer and that well might advise him to a caution to hold what distance his wisdom can provide some holy angel fly to the court of england and

brightest fell though all things foul would wear the brows of grace yet grace must still look so i have lost my hopes perchance even there where i did find my doubts why in that rawness left you wife

creatures living should we ne'er have use for 'em and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their sounds to themselves why i have often wished myself poorer that i might come nearer to you we are born to do benefits and what better or properer can we can our own than the riches of our friends o what a precious comfort tis to have so many like brothers commanding one another 's fortunes o joy e'en made away ere t can be born mine eyes can not hold out water methinks to forget their faults i drink to you thou weepest to make them drink timon joy had the like

mine honesty when for some trifling present you have bid me return so much i have shook my head and wept yea gainst the authority of manners pray'd you to hold your hand more close i did endure not

lacks a half to pay your present debts let all my land be sold tis all engaged some forfeited and gone and what remains will hardly stop the mouth of present dues the future comes apace what shall defend the interim and at length how goes our reckoning to lacedaemon did my land extend o my good lord the world is but a word were it all yours to give it in a breath how quickly were it gone you tell me true if you suspect my husbandry or falsehood call me before the exactest auditors and set me on the proof so the gods bless me when all our offices have been oppress'd with riotous feeders when our vaults have wept with drunken spilth of wine when every room hath blazed with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy i have retired me to a wasteful cock and set mine eyes at flow prithee no more heavens have i said the bounty of this lord how many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants this night englutted who is not timon 's what heart head sword force means but is lord timon 's great timon noble worthy royal timon ah when the means are gone that buy this praise the breath is gone whereof this praise is made feast won fast lost one cloud of winter showers these flies are couch'd come sermon me no further no villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart unwisely not ignobly have i given why dost thou weep canst thou the conscience lack to think i shall lack friends secure thy heart if i would broach the vessels of my love and try the argument of hearts by borrowing men and men 's fortunes could i frankly use as i can bid thee speak assurance bless your thoughts and in some sort

me to their loves and i am proud say that my occasions have found time to use 'em toward a supply of money let the request be fifty talents as you have said my lord aside   lord lucius and lucullus hum go you sir to the senators-- of whom even to the state 's best health i have deserved this hearing bid 'em send o the instant a thousand talents to me i have been bold-- for that i knew it the most general way-- to them to use your signet and your name but they do shake their heads and i am here no richer in return is't true ca n't be they answer in a joint and corporate voice that now they are at fall want treasure can not do what they would are sorry you are honourable,-- but yet they could have wish'd they know not-- something hath been amiss a noble nature may catch a wrench would all were well--'tis pity;-- and so intending other serious matters after distasteful looks and these hard fractions with certain half caps and cold moving nods they froze me into silence you gods reward them prithee man look cheerly these old fellows have their ingratitude in them hereditary their blood is caked tis cold it seldom flows tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind and nature as it grows again toward earth is fashion'd for the journey dull and heavy to a servant go to ventidius to flavius prithee be not sad thou art true and honest ingeniously i speak no blame belongs to thee to servant ventidius lately buried his father by whose death he 's stepp'd into a great estate when he was poor imprison'd and in scarcity of friends i clear'd him with five talents greet him from me bid him suppose some good necessity touches his friend which craves to be remember'd with those five talents exit servant to flavius that had give't these fellows to whom tis instant due ne'er speak

complete free hearted gentleman of athens thy very bountiful good lord and master his health is well sir i am right glad that his health is well sir and what hast thou there under thy cloak pretty flaminius faith nothing but an empty box sir which in my lord 's behalf i come to entreat your honour to supply who having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents hath sent to your lordship to furnish him nothing doubting your present assistance therein la la la la nothing doubting says he alas good lord a noble gentleman tis if he would not keep so good a house many a time and often i ha dined with him and told him on't and come again to supper to him of purpose to have him spend less and yet he would embrace no counsel take no warning by my coming every man has his fault and honesty is his i ha told him on't but i could ne'er get him from't re enter servant with wine please your lordship here is the wine flaminius i have noted thee always wise here 's to thee your lordship speaks your pleasure i have observed thee always for a towardly prompt spirit give thee thy due and one that knows what belongs to reason and canst use the time well if the time use thee well good parts in thee to servant get you gone sirrah exit servant draw nearer honest flaminius thy lord 's a bountiful gentleman but thou art wise and thou knowest well enough although thou comest to me that this is no time to lend money especially upon bare friendship without security here 's three solidares for thee good boy wink at me and say thou sawest me not fare thee well is't possible the world should so much differ and we alive that lived fly damned baseness to him that worships thee throwing the money back ha now i see thou art a fool and fit for thy master exit may these add to the number that may scald thee let moulten coin be thy damnation thou disease of a friend and not himself has friendship such a faint and milky heart it turns in less than two nights o you gods i feel master 's passion this slave unto his honour has my lord 's meat in him why should it thrive and turn to nutriment when he is turn'd to poison o may diseases only work upon't and when he 's sick to death let not that part of nature which my lord paid for be of any power to expel sickness but prolong his hour exit scene ii a public place enter lucilius with three strangers who the lord timon he is my very good friend and an honourable gentleman we know him for no less though we are but strangers to him but i can tell you one thing my lord and which i hear from common rumours now lord timon 's happy hours are done and past and his estate shrinks from him fie no do not believe it he can not want for money but believe you this my lord that not long ago one of his men was with the lord lucullus to borrow so many talents nay urged extremely for't and showed what necessity belonged to't and yet was denied how i tell you denied my lord what a strange case was that now before the gods i am ashamed on't denied that honourable man there was very little honour showed in't for my own part i must needs confess i have received some small kindnesses from him as money plate jewels and such like trifles nothing comparing to his yet had he mistook him and sent to me i should ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents enter servilius see by good hap yonder 's my lord i have sweat to see his honour my honoured lord,-- to lucius servilius you are kindly met sir fare thee well commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord my very exquisite friend may it please your honour my lord hath sent-- ha what has he sent i am so much endeared to that lord he 's ever sending how shall i thank him thinkest thou and what has he sent now has only sent his present occasion now my lord requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talents i know his lordship is but merry with me he can not want fifty five hundred talents but in the mean time he wants less my lord if his occasion were not virtuous i should not urge it half so faithfully dost thou speak seriously servilius upon my soul,'tis true sir what a wicked beast was i to disfurnish myself against such a good time when i might ha shown myself honourable how unluckily it happened that i should purchase the day before for a little part and undo a great deal of honoured servilius now before the gods i am not able to do,--the more beast i say:--i was sending to use lord timon myself these gentlemen can witness but i would not for the wealth of athens i had done't now commend me bountifully to his good lordship and i hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me because i have no power to be kind and tell him this from me i count it one of my greatest afflictions say that i can not pleasure such an honourable gentleman good servilius will you befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him yes sir i shall i 'll look you out a good turn servilius exit servilius true as you said timon is shrunk indeed and he that 's once denied will hardly speed exit do you observe this hostilius ay too well why this is the world 's soul and just of the same piece is every flatterer 's spirit who can call him his friend that dips in the same dish for in my knowing timon has been this lord 's father and kept his credit with his purse supported his estate nay timon 's money has paid his men their wages he ne'er drinks but timon 's silver treads upon his lip and yet o see the monstrousness of man when he looks out in an ungrateful shape!-- he does deny him in respect of his what charitable men afford to beggars religion groans at it for mine own part i never tasted timon in my life nor came any of his bounties over me to mark me for his friend yet i protest for his right noble mind illustrious virtue and honourable carriage had his necessity made use of me i would have put my wealth into donation and the best half should have return'd to him so much i love his heart but i perceive men must learn now with pity to dispense for policy sits above conscience exeunt scene iii a room in sempronius house enter sempronius and a servant of timon 's must he needs trouble me in t,--hum!--'bove all others he might have tried lord lucius or lucullus and now ventidius is wealthy too whom he redeem'd from prison all these owe their estates unto him my lord they have all been touch'd and found base metal for they have au denied him how have they denied him has ventidius and lucullus denied him and does he send to me three hum it shows but little love or judgment in him must i be his last refuge his friends like physicians thrive give him over must i take the cure upon me has much disgraced me in't i 'm angry at him that might have known my place i see no sense for't but his occasion might have woo'd me first for in my conscience i was the first man that e'er received gift from him and does he think so backwardly of me now that i 'll requite its last no so it may prove an argument of laughter to the rest and mongst lords i be thought a fool i'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum had sent to me first but for my mind 's sake i 'd such a courage to do him good but now return and with their faint reply this answer join who bates mine honour shall not know my coin exit excellent your lordship 's a goodly villain the devil knew not what he did when he made man politic he crossed himself by t and i can not think but in the end the villainies of man will set him clear how fairly this lord strives to appear foul takes virtuous copies to be wicked like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire of such a nature is his politic love this was my lord 's best hope now all are fled save only the gods now his friends are dead doors that were ne'er acquainted with their wards many a bounteous year must be employ'd now to guard sure their master and this is all a liberal course allows who can not keep his wealth must keep his house exit scene iv the same a hall in timon 's

lord seen yet lucilius servant \t not yet i wonder on't he was wo nt to shine at seven lucilius servant \t ay but the days are wax'd shorter with him you must consider that a prodigal course is like the sun 's but not like his recoverable i fear tis deepest winter in lord timon 's purse that is one may reach deep enough and yet find little i am of your fear for that i 'll show you how to observe a strange event your lord sends now for money most true he does and he wears jewels now of timon 's gift for which i wait for money it is against my heart lucilius servant \t mark how strange it shows timon in this should pay more than he owes and e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels and send for money for 'em i 'm weary of this charge the gods can witness i know my lord hath spent of timon 's wealth and now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth varro 's yes mine 's three thousand crowns what 's yours lucilius servant \t five thousand mine varro 's tis much deep and it should seem by the sun your master 's confidence was above mine else surely his had equall'd enter flaminius one of lord timon 's men lucilius servant \t flaminius sir a word pray is my lord ready to come forth no

muffled so he goes away in a cloud call him call him do you hear sir varro 's by your leave sir,-- what do ye ask of me my friend we wait for certain money here sir ay if money were as certain as your waiting twere sure enough why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills when your false masters eat of my lord 's meat then they could smile and fawn upon his debts and take down the interest into their gluttonous maws you do yourselves but wrong to stir me up let me pass quietly believe t my lord and i have made an end i have no more to reckon he to spend lucilius servant \t ay but this answer will not serve if twill not serve,'tis not so base as you for you serve knaves exit varro 's how what does his cashiered worship mutter varro 's no matter what he 's poor and that 's revenge enough who can speak broader than he that has no house to put his head in such may rail against great buildings enter servilius o here 's servilius now we shall know some answer if i might beseech you gentlemen to repair some other hour i should derive much from't for take't of my soul my lord leans wondrously to discontent his comfortable temper has forsook him he 's much out of health and keeps his chamber lucilius servant many do keep their chambers are not sick and if it be so far beyond his health methinks he should the sooner pay his debts and make a clear way to the gods good gods we can not take this for answer sir within   servilius help my lord my lord enter timon in a rage flaminius following what are my doors opposed against my passage have i been ever free and must my house

bloody tis necessary he should die nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy most true the law shall bruise him enter alcibiades with attendants honour health and compassion to the senate now captain i am an humble suitor to your virtues for pity is the virtue of the law and none but tyrants use it cruelly it pleases time and fortune to lie heavy upon a friend of mine who in hot blood hath stepp'd into the law which is past depth to those that without heed do plunge into t. he is a man setting his fate aside of comely virtues nor did he soil the fact with cowardice-- an honour in him which buys out his fault-- but with a noble fury and fair spirit seeing his reputation touch'd to death he did oppose his foe and with such sober and unnoted passion he did behave his anger ere twas spent as if he had but proved an argument you undergo too strict a paradox striving to make an ugly deed look fair your words have took such pains as if they labour'd to bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling upon the head of valour which indeed is valour misbegot and came into the world when sects and factions were newly born he 's truly valiant that can wisely suffer the worst that man can breathe and make his wrongs his outsides to wear them like his raiment carelessly and ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart to bring it into danger if wrongs be evils and enforce us kill what folly tis to hazard life for ill my lord,-- you can not make gross sins look clear to revenge is no valour but to bear my lords then under favour pardon me if i speak like a captain why do fond men expose themselves to battle and not endure all threats sleep upon't and let the foes quietly cut their throats without repugnancy if there be such valour in the bearing what make we abroad why then women are more valiant that stay at home if bearing carry it and the ass more captain than the lion the felon loaden with irons wiser than the judge if wisdom be in suffering o my lords as you are great be pitifully good who can not condemn rashness in cold blood to kill i grant is sin 's extremest gust but in defence by mercy tis most just to be in anger is impiety but who is man that is not angry weigh but the crime with this you breathe in vain in vain his service done at lacedaemon and byzantium were a sufficient briber for his life what 's that i say my lords he has done fair service and slain in fight many of your enemies how full of valour did he bear himself in the last conflict and made plenteous wounds he has made too much plenty with 'em he 's a sworn rioter he has a sin that often drowns him and takes his valour prisoner if there were no foes that were enough to overcome him in that beastly fury he has been known to commit outrages and cherish factions tis inferr'd to us his days are foul and his drink dangerous he dies hard fate he might have died in war my lords if not for any parts in him-- though his right arm might purchase his own time and be in debt to none yet more to move you take my deserts to his and join 'em both and for i know your reverend ages love security i 'll pawn my victories all my honours to you upon his good returns if by this crime he owes the law his life why let the war receive t in valiant gore for law is strict and war is nothing more we are for law he dies urge it no more on height of our displeasure friend or brother he forfeits his own blood that spills another must it be so it must not be my lords i do beseech you know me how call me to your remembrances what i can not think but your age has forgot me it could not else be i should prove so base to sue and be denied such common grace my wounds ache at you do you dare our anger tis in few words but spacious in effect we banish thee for ever banish me banish your dotage banish usury that makes the senate ugly if after two days shine athens contain thee attend our weightier judgment and not to swell our spirit he shall be executed presently exeunt senators now the gods keep you old enough that you may live only in bone that none may look on you i 'm worse than mad i have kept back their foes while they have told their money and let out their coin upon large interest i myself rich only in large hurts all those for this is this the balsam that the usuring senate pours into captains wounds banishment it comes not ill i hate not to be banish'd it is a cause

several friends it should not be by the persuasion of his new feasting i should think so he hath sent me an earnest inviting which many my near occasions did urge me to put off but he hath conjured me beyond them and i must needs appear in like manner was i in debt to my importunate business but he would not hear my excuse i am sorry when he sent to borrow of me that my provision was out i am sick

doubt and suspect alas are placed too late you should have fear'd false times when you did feast suspect still comes where an estate is least that which i show heaven knows is merely love duty and zeal to your unmatched mind care of your food and living and believe it my most honour'd lord for any benefit that points to me either in hope or present i'ld exchange for this one wish that you had

watching them from his cave as i took note of the place it can not be far where he abides what 's to be thought of him does the rumour hold for true that he 's so full of gold certain alcibiades reports it phrynia and timandra had gold of him he likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers with great quantity tis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends nothing else you shall see him a palm in athens again and flourish with the highest therefore tis not amiss we tender our loves to him in this supposed distress of his it will show honestly in us and is very likely to load our purposes with what they travail for if it be a just true report that goes of his having what have you now to present unto him nothing at this time but my visitation only i will promise him an excellent piece i must serve him so too tell him of an intent that 's coming toward him good as the best promising is the very air o the time it opens the eyes of expectation performance is ever the duller for his act and but in the plainer and simpler kind of people the deed of saying is quite out of use to promise is most courtly and fashionable performance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes it timon comes from his cave behind aside   excellent workman thou canst not paint a man so bad as is thyself i am thinking what i shall say i have provided for him it must be a personating of himself a satire against the softness of prosperity with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that

athens who have thought on special dignities which vacant lie for thy best use and wearing they confess toward thee forgetfulness too general gross which now the public body which doth seldom play the recanter feeling in itself a lack of timon 's aid hath sense withal of its own fail restraining aid to timon and send forth us to make their sorrow'd render together with a recompense more fruitful than their offence can weigh down by the dram ay even such heaps and sums of love and wealth as shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs and write in thee the figures of their love ever to read them thine you witch me in it surprise me to the very brink of tears lend me a fool 's heart and a woman 's eyes and i 'll beweep these comforts worthy senators therefore so please thee to return with

the approaches wild who like a boar too savage doth root up his country 's peace and shakes his threatening sword against the walls of athens therefore timon,-- well sir i will therefore i will sir thus if alcibiades kill my countrymen let alcibiades know this of timon that timon cares not but if be sack fair athens and take our goodly aged men by the beards giving our holy virgins to the stain of contumelious beastly mad brain'd war then let him know and tell him timon speaks it in pity of our aged and our youth i can not choose but tell him that i care not and let him take't at worst for their knives care not while you have throats to answer for myself there 's not a whittle in the unruly camp but i do prize it at my love before the reverend'st throat in athens so i leave you to the

nothing brings me all things go live still be alcibiades your plague you his and last so long enough we speak in vain but yet i love my country and am not one that rejoices in the common wreck as common bruit doth put it that 's well spoke commend me to my loving countrymen,-- these words become your lips as they pass thorough them and enter in our ears like great triumphers in their applauding gates commend me to them and tell them that to ease them of their griefs their fears of hostile strokes their aches losses their pangs of love with other incident throes that nature 's fragile vessel doth sustain in life 's uncertain voyage i will some kindness do them i 'll teach them to prevent wild alcibiades wrath i like this well he will return again i have a tree which grows here in my close that mine own use invites me to cut down and shortly must i fell it tell my friends tell athens in the sequence of degree from high to low throughout that whoso please to stop affliction let him take his haste come hither ere my tree hath felt the axe and hang himself i pray you do my greeting trouble him no further thus you still shall find him come not to me again but say

perchance are to this business purblind say business my lord i think most understand bohemia stays here longer ha stays here longer ay but why to satisfy your highness and the entreaties of our most gracious mistress satisfy the entreaties of your mistress satisfy let that suffice i have trusted thee camillo with all the nearest things to my heart as well my chamber councils wherein priest like thou hast cleansed my bosom i from thee departed thy penitent reform'd but we have been deceived in thy integrity deceived in that which seems so be it forbid my lord to bide upon't thou art not honest or if thou inclinest that way thou art a coward which hoxes honesty behind restraining from course required or else thou must be counted a servant grafted in my serious trust and therein negligent or else a fool that seest a game play'd home the rich stake drawn and takest it all for jest my gracious lord i may be negligent foolish and fearful in every one of these no man is free but that his negligence his folly fear among the infinite doings of the world sometime puts forth in your affairs my lord if ever i were wilful negligent it was my folly if industriously i play'd the fool it was my negligence not weighing well the end if ever fearful to do a thing where i the issue doubted where of the execution did cry out against the non performance twas a fear which oft infects the wisest these my lord are such allow'd infirmities that honesty is never free of but beseech your grace be plainer with me let me know my trespass by its own visage if i then deny it tis none of mine ha not you seen camillo,-- but that 's past doubt you have or your eye glass is thicker than a cuckold 's horn,--or heard,-- for to a vision so apparent rumour can not be mute,--or thought,--for

horse deserves a name as rank as any flax wench that puts to before her troth plight say't and justify't i would not be a stander by to hear my sovereign mistress clouded so without my present vengeance taken shrew my heart you never spoke what did become you less than this which to reiterate were sin as deep as that though true is whispering nothing is leaning cheek to cheek is meeting noses kissing with inside lip stopping the career of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible of breaking honesty horsing foot on foot skulking in corners wishing clocks more swift hours minutes noon midnight and all eyes blind with the pin and web but theirs theirs only that would unseen be wicked is this nothing why then the world and all that 's in't is nothing the covering sky is nothing bohemia nothing my wife is nothing nor nothing have these nothings if this be nothing good my lord be cured of this diseased opinion and betimes for tis most dangerous say it be tis true no no my lord it is you lie you lie i say thou liest camillo and i hate thee pronounce thee a gross lout a mindless slave or else a hovering temporizer that canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil inclining to them both were my wife 's liver infected as her life she would not live the running of one glass who does infect her why he that wears her like a medal hanging about his neck bohemia who if i had servants true about me that bare eyes to see alike mine honour as their profits their own particular thrifts they would do that which should undo more doing ay and thou his cupbearer,--whom i from meaner form have benched and reared to worship who mayst see plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven how i am galled,--mightst bespice a cup to give mine enemy a lasting wink which draught to me were cordial sir my lord i could do this and that with no rash potion but with a lingering dram that should not work maliciously like poison but i can not believe this crack to be in my dread mistress so sovereignly being honourable i have loved thee,-- make that thy question and go rot dost think i am so muddy so unsettled to appoint myself in this vexation sully the purity and whiteness of my sheets which to preserve is sleep which being spotted is goads thorns nettles tails of wasps give scandal to the blood o the prince my son who i do think is mine and love as mine without ripe moving to't would i do this could man so blench i must believe you sir i do and will fetch off bohemia for't provided that when he 's removed your highness will take again your queen as yours at first even for your son 's sake and thereby for sealing the injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms known and allied to yours thou dost advise me even so as i mine own course have set down i 'll give no blemish to her honour none my lord go then and with a countenance as clear as friendship wears at feasts keep with bohemia and with your queen i am his cupbearer if from me he have wholesome beverage account me not your servant this is all do't and thou hast the one half of my heart do't not thou split'st thine own i 'll do't my lord i will seem friendly as thou hast advised me exit o miserable lady but for me what case stand i in i must be the poisoner of good polixenes and my ground to do't is the obedience to a master one who in rebellion with himself will have all that are his so too to do this deed promotion follows if i could find example of thousands that had struck anointed kings and flourish'd after i'ld not do't but since nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one let villany itself forswear't i must forsake the court to do't or no is certain to me a break neck happy star reign now here comes bohemia re enter polixenes this is strange methinks my favour here begins to warp not speak good day camillo hail most royal sir what is the news i the court none rare my lord the king hath on him such a countenance as he had lost some province and a region loved as he loves himself even now i met him with customary compliment when he wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling a lip of much contempt speeds from me and so leaves me to consider what is breeding that changeth thus his manners i dare not know my lord how dare not do not do you know and dare not be intelligent to me tis thereabouts for to yourself what you do know you must and can not say you dare not good camillo your changed complexions are to me a mirror which shows me mine changed too for i must be a party in this alteration finding myself thus alter'd with t. there is a sickness which puts some of us in distemper but i can not name the disease and it is caught of you that yet are well how caught of me make me not sighted like the basilisk i have look'd on thousands who have sped the better by my regard but kill'd none so camillo,-- as you are certainly a gentleman thereto clerk like experienced which no less adorns our gentry than our parents noble names in whose success we are gentle,--i beseech you if you know aught which does behove my knowledge thereof to be inform'd imprison't not in ignorant concealment i may not answer a sickness caught of me and yet i well i must be answer'd dost thou hear camillo i conjure thee by all the parts of man which honour does acknowledge whereof the least is not this suit of mine that thou declare what incidency thou dost guess of harm is creeping toward me how far off how near which way to be prevented if to be if not how best to bear it sir i will tell you since i am charged in honour and by him that i think honourable therefore mark my counsel which must be even as swiftly follow'd as i mean to utter it or both yourself and me cry lost and so good night on good camillo i am appointed him to murder you by whom camillo by the king for what he thinks nay with all confidence he swears as he had seen't or been an instrument to vice you to't that you have touch'd his queen forbiddenly o then my best blood turn to an infected jelly and my name be yoked with his that did betray the best turn then my freshest reputation to a savour that may strike the dullest nostril where i arrive and my approach be shunn'd nay hated too

yet partake no venom for his knowledge is not infected but if one present the abhorr'd ingredient to his eye make known how he hath drunk he cracks his gorge his sides with violent hefts i have drunk

o thou thing which i 'll not call a creature of thy place lest barbarism making me the precedent should a like language use to all degrees and mannerly distinguishment leave out betwixt the prince and beggar i have said she 's an adulteress i have said with whom more she 's a traitor and camillo is a federary with her and one that knows what she should shame to know herself but with her most vile principal that she 's a bed swerver even as bad as those that vulgars give bold'st titles ay and privy to this their late escape no by my life privy to none of this how will this grieve you when you shall come to clearer knowledge that you thus have publish'd me gentle my lord you scarce can right me throughly then to say you did mistake no if i mistake in those foundations which i build upon the

three days they have been absent tis good speed foretells the great apollo suddenly will have the truth of this appear prepare you lords summon a session that we may arraign our most disloyal lady for

sicilia enter cleomenes and dion the climate 's delicate the air most sweet fertile the isle the temple much surpassing the common praise it bears i shall report for most it caught me the celestial habits methinks i so should term them and the reverence of the grave wearers o the sacrifice how ceremonious solemn and unearthly it was i the offering but of all the burst and the ear deafening voice o the oracle kin to jove 's thunder so surprised my sense that i was nothing if the event o the journey prove as successful to the queen,--o be't so!-- as it hath been to us rare pleasant speedy the time is worth the use on't great apollo turn all to the best these proclamations so forcing faults upon hermione i little like the violent carriage of it will clear or end the business when the oracle thus by apollo 's great divine seal'd up shall the contents discover something rare even then will rush to knowledge go fresh horses and gracious be the issue exeunt scene ii a court of justice enter leontes lords and officers this sessions to our great grief we pronounce even pushes gainst our heart the party tried the daughter of a king our wife and one of us too much beloved let us be clear'd of being tyrannous since we so openly proceed in justice which shall have due course even to the guilt or the purgation produce the prisoner it is his highness pleasure that the queen appear in person here in court silence enter hermione guarded paulina and ladies attending read the indictment reads             hermione queen to the worthy leontes king of sicilia thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason in committing adultery with polixenes king of bohemia and conspiring with camillo to take away the life of our sovereign lord the king thy royal husband the pretence whereof being by circumstances partly laid open thou hermione contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject didst counsel and aid them for their better safety to fly away by night since what i am to say must be but that which contradicts my accusation and the testimony on my part no other but what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me to say not guilty mine integrity being counted falsehood shall as i express it be so received but thus if powers divine behold our human actions as they do i doubt not then but innocence shall make false accusation blush and tyranny tremble at patience you my lord best know who least will seem to do so my past life hath been as continent as chaste as true as i am now unhappy which is more than history can pattern though devised and play'd to take spectators for behold me a fellow of the royal bed which owe a moiety of the throne a great king 's daughter the mother to a hopeful prince here standing to prate and talk for life and honour fore who please to come and hear for life i prize it as i weigh grief which i would spare for honour tis a derivative from me to mine and only that i stand for i appeal to your own conscience sir before polixenes came to your court how i was in your grace how merited to be so since he came with what encounter so uncurrent i have strain'd to appear thus if one jot beyond the bound of honour or in act or will that way inclining harden'd be the hearts of all that hear me and my near'st of kin cry fie upon my grave i ne'er heard yet that any of these bolder vices wanted less impudence to gainsay what they did than to perform it first that 's true enough through tis a saying sir not due to me you will not own it more than mistress of which comes to me in name of fault i must not at all acknowledge for polixenes with whom i am accused i do confess i loved him as in honour he required with such a kind of love as might become a lady like me with a love even such so and no other as yourself commanded which not to have done i think had been in me both disobedience and ingratitude to you and toward your friend whose love had spoke even since it could speak from an infant freely that it was yours now for conspiracy i know not how it tastes though it be dish'd for me to try how all i know of it is that camillo was an honest man and why he left your court the gods themselves wotting no more than i are ignorant you knew of his departure as you know what you have underta'en to do in 's absence sir you speak a language that i understand not my life stands in the level of your dreams which i 'll lay down your actions are my dreams you had a bastard by polixenes and i but dream'd it as you were past all shame,-- those of your fact are so so past all truth which to deny concerns more than avails for as thy brat hath been cast out like to itself no father owning it,--which is indeed more criminal in thee than it,--so thou shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage look for no less than death sir spare your threats the bug which you would fright me with i seek to me can life be no commodity the crown and comfort of my life your favour i do give lost for i do feel it gone but know not how it went my second joy and first fruits of my body from his presence i am barr'd like one infectious my third comfort starr'd most unluckily is from my breast the innocent milk in its most innocent mouth haled out to murder myself on every post proclaimed a strumpet with immodest hatred the child bed privilege denied which longs to women of all fashion lastly hurried here to this place i the open air before i have got strength of limit now my liege tell me what blessings i have here alive that i should fear to die therefore proceed but yet hear this mistake me not no life i prize it not a straw but for mine honour which i would free if i shall be condemn'd upon surmises all proofs sleeping else but what your jealousies awake i tell you tis rigor and not law your honours all i do refer me to the oracle apollo be my judge this your request is altogether just therefore bring forth and in apollos name his oracle exeunt certain officers the emperor of russia was my father o that he were alive and here beholding his daughter 's trial that he did but see the flatness of my misery yet with eyes of pity not revenge re enter officers with cleomenes and dion you here shall swear upon this sword of justice that you cleomenes and dion have been both at delphos and from thence have brought the seal'd up oracle by the hand deliver'd of great apollo 's priest and that since then you have not dared to break the holy seal nor read the secrets in't all this we swear break up the seals and read reads \t hermione is chaste polixenes blameless camillo a true subject leontes a jealous tyrant

news is mortal to the queen look down and see what death is doing take her hence her heart is but o'ercharged she will recover i have too much believed mine own suspicion beseech you tenderly apply to her some remedies for life exeunt paulina and ladies with hermione apollo pardon my great profaneness gainst thine oracle i 'll reconcile me to polixenes new woo my queen recall the good camillo whom i proclaim a man of truth of mercy for being transported by my jealousies to bloody thoughts and to revenge i chose camillo for the minister to poison my friend polixenes which had been done but that the good mind of camillo tardied my swift command though i with death and with reward did threaten and encourage him not doing t and being done he most humane and fill'd with honour to my kingly guest unclasp'd my practise quit his fortunes here which you knew great and to the hazard of all encertainties himself commended no richer than his honour how he glisters thorough my rust and how his pity does my deeds make the blacker re enter paulina woe the while o cut my lace lest my heart cracking it break too what fit is this good lady what studied torments tyrant hast for me what wheels racks fires what flaying boiling in leads or oils what old or newer torture must i receive whose every word deserves to taste of thy most worst thy tyranny together working with thy jealousies fancies too weak for boys too green and idle for girls of nine o think what they have done and then run mad indeed stark mad for all thy by gone fooleries were but spices of it that thou betray'dst polixenes,'twas nothing that did but show thee of a fool inconstant and damnable ingrateful nor was't much thou wouldst have poison'd good camillo 's honour to have him kill a king poor trespasses more monstrous standing by whereof i reckon the casting forth to crows thy baby daughter to be or none or little though a devil would have shed water out of fire ere done't nor is't directly laid to thee the death of the young prince whose honourable thoughts thoughts high for one so tender cleft the heart that could conceive a gross and foolish sire blemish'd his gracious dam this is not no laid to thy answer but the last,--o lords when i have said cry woe the queen the queen the sweet'st dear'st creature 's dead and vengeance for't not dropp'd down yet the higher powers forbid i say she 's dead i 'll swear't if word nor oath prevail not go and see if you can bring tincture or lustre in her lip her eye heat outwardly or breath within i 'll serve you as i would do the gods but o thou tyrant do not repent these things for they are heavier than all thy woes can stir therefore betake thee to nothing but despair a thousand knees ten thousand years together naked fasting upon a barren mountain and still winter in storm perpetual could not move the gods to look that way thou wert go on go on thou canst not speak too much i have deserved all tongues to talk their bitterest say no more howe'er the business goes you have made fault i the boldness of your speech i am sorry for't all faults i make when i shall come to know them i do repent alas i have show'd too much the rashness of a woman he is touch'd to the noble heart what 's gone and what 's past help should be past grief do not receive affliction at my petition i beseech you rather let me be punish'd that have minded you of what you should forget now good my liege sir royal sir forgive a foolish woman the love i bore your queen lo fool again!-- i 'll speak of her no more nor of your children i 'll not remember you of my own lord who is lost too take your patience to you and i 'll say nothing thou didst speak but well when most the truth which i receive much better than to be pitied of thee prithee bring me to the dead bodies of my queen and son one grave shall be for both upon them shall the causes of their death appear unto our shame perpetual once a day i 'll visit the chapel where they lie and tears shed there shall be my recreation so long as nature will bear up with this exercise so long i daily vow to use it come and lead me unto these sorrows exeunt scene iii bohemia a desert country near the

like a waking to me comes a creature sometimes her head on one side some another i never saw a vessel of like sorrow so fill'd and so becoming in pure white robes like very sanctity she did approach my cabin where i lay thrice bow'd before me and gasping to begin some speech her eyes became two spouts the fury spent anon did this break from her good antigonus since fate against thy better disposition hath made thy person for the thrower out of my poor babe according to thine oath places remote enough are in bohemia there weep and leave it crying and for the babe is counted lost for ever perdita i prithee call't for this ungentle business put on thee by my lord thou ne'er shalt see thy wife paulina more and so with shrieks she melted into air affrighted much i did in time collect myself and thought this was so and no slumber dreams are toys yet for this once yea superstitiously i will be squared by this i do believe hermione hath suffer'd death and that apollo would this being indeed the issue of king polixenes it should here be laid either for life or death upon the earth of its right father blossom speed thee well there lie and there thy character there these which may if

shorten thy life one week and thou fresh piece of excellent witchcraft who of force must know the royal fool thou copest with,-- o my heart i 'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers and made more homely than thy state for thee fond boy if i may ever know thou dost but sigh that thou no more shalt see this knack as never i mean thou shalt we 'll bar thee from succession not hold thee of our blood no not our kin far than deucalion off mark thou my words follow us to the court thou churl for this time though full of our displeasure yet we free thee from the dead blow of it and you enchantment.-- worthy enough a herdsman yea him too that makes himself but for our honour therein unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou these rural latches to his entrance open or hoop his body more with thy embraces i will devise a death as cruel for thee as thou art tender to't exit even here undone i was not much afeard for once or twice i was about to speak and tell him plainly the selfsame

dream of mine,-- being now awake i 'll queen it no inch farther but milk my ewes and weep why how now father speak ere thou diest i can not speak nor think nor dare to know that which i know o sir you have undone a man of fourscore three that thought to fill his grave in quiet yea to die upon the bed my father died to lie close by his honest bones but now some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me where no priest shovels in dust o cursed wretch that knew'st this was the prince and wouldst adventure to mingle faith with him undone undone if i might die within this hour i have lived to die when i desire exit why look you so upon me i am but sorry not afeard delay'd but nothing alter'd what i was i am more straining on for plucking back not following my leash unwillingly gracious my lord you know your father 's temper at this time he will allow no speech which i do guess you do not purpose to him and as hardly will he endure your sight as yet i fear then till the fury of his highness settle come not before him i not purpose it i think camillo even he my lord how often have i told you twould be thus how often said my dignity would last but till twere known it can not fail but by the violation of my faith and then let nature crush the sides o the earth together and mar the seeds within lift up thy looks from my succession wipe me father i am heir to my affection be advised i am and by my fancy if my reason will thereto be obedient i have reason if not my senses better pleased with madness do bid it welcome this is desperate sir so call it but it does fulfil my vow i needs must think it honesty camillo not for bohemia nor the pomp that may be thereat glean'd for all the sun sees or the close earth wombs or the profound sea hides in unknown fathoms will i break my oath to this my fair beloved therefore i pray you as you have ever been my father 's honour'd friend when he shall miss me,--as in faith i mean not to see him any more,--cast your good counsels upon his passion let myself and fortune tug for the time to come this you may know and so deliver i am put to sea with her whom here i can not hold on shore and most opportune to our need i have a vessel rides fast by but not prepared for this design what course i mean to hold shall nothing benefit your knowledge nor concern me the reporting o my lord i would your spirit were easier for advice or stronger for your need hark perdita drawing her aside i 'll hear you by and by he 's irremoveable resolved for flight now were i happy if his going i could frame to serve my turn save him from danger do him love and honour purchase the sight again of dear sicilia and that unhappy king my master whom i so much thirst to see now good camillo i am so fraught with curious business that i leave out ceremony sir i think you have heard of my poor services i the love that i have borne your father very nobly have you deserved it is my father 's music to speak your deeds not little of his care to have them recompensed as thought on well my lord if you may please to think i love the king and through him what is nearest to him which is your gracious self embrace but my direction if your more ponderous and settled project may suffer alteration on mine honour i 'll point you where you shall have such receiving as shall become your highness where you may enjoy your mistress from the whom i see there 's no disjunction to be made but by-- as heavens forefend!--your ruin marry her and with my best endeavours in your absence your discontenting father strive to qualify and bring him up to liking how camillo may this almost a miracle be done that i may call thee something more than man and after that trust to thee have you thought on a place whereto you 'll go not any yet but as the unthought on accident

flight make for sicilia and there present yourself and your fair princess for so i see she must be fore leontes she shall be habited as it becomes the partner of your bed methinks i see leontes opening his free arms and weeping his welcomes forth asks thee the son forgiveness as twere i the father 's person kisses the hands of your fresh princess o'er and o'er divides him twixt his unkindness and his kindness the one he chides to hell and bids the other grow faster than thought or time worthy camillo what colour for my visitation shall i hold up before him sent by the king your

shall point you forth at every sitting what you must say that he shall not perceive but that you have your father 's bosom there and speak his very heart i am bound to you there is some sap in this a cause more promising than a wild dedication of yourselves to unpath'd waters undream'd shores most certain to miseries enough no hope to help you but as you shake off one to take another nothing so certain as your anchors who do their best office if they can but stay you where you 'll be loath to be besides you know prosperity 's the very bond of love whose fresh complexion and whose heart

my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer by which means i saw whose purse was best in picture and what i saw to my good use i remembered my clown who wants but something to be a reasonable man grew so in love with the wenches song that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears you might have pinched a placket it was senseless twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse i could have filed keys off that hung in chains no hearing no feeling but my sir 's song and admiring the nothing of it so that in this time of lethargy i picked and cut most of their festival purses and had not the old man come in with a whoo bub against his daughter and the king 's son and scared my choughs from the chaff i had not left a purse alive in the whole army camillo florizel and perdita come forward nay but my letters by this means being there so soon as you arrive shall clear

now meet my father he would not call me son nay you shall have no hat giving it to perdita come lady come farewell my friend adieu sir o perdita what have we twain forgot pray you a word aside   what i do next shall be to tell the king of this escape and whither they are bound wherein my hope is i shall so prevail to force him after in whose company i shall review sicilia for whose sight i have a woman 's longing fortune speed us thus we set on camillo to the sea side the swifter speed the better exeunt florizel perdita and camillo i understand the business i hear it to have an open ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is necessary for a cut purse a good nose is requisite also to smell out work for the other senses i see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive what an exchange had this been without boot what a boot is here with this exchange sure the gods do this year connive at us and we may do any thing extempore the prince himself is about a piece of iniquity stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels if i thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king withal i would not do't i hold it the more knavery to conceal it and therein am i constant to my profession re enter clown and shepherd aside aside here is more matter for a hot brain every lane 's end every shop church session hanging yields a careful man work see see what a man you are now there is no other way but to tell the king she 's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood nay but hear me nay but hear me go to then she being none of your flesh and blood your flesh and blood has not offended the king and so your flesh and blood is not to be punished by him show those things you found about her those secret things all but what she has with her this being done let the law go whistle i warrant you i will tell the king all every word yea and his son 's pranks too who i may say is no honest man neither to his father nor to me to go about to make me the king 's brother in law indeed brother in law was the farthest off you could have been to him and then your blood had been the dearer by i know how much an ounce aside   very wisely puppies well let us to the king there is that in this fardel will make him scratch his beard aside   i know not what impediment this complaint may be to the flight of my master pray heartily he be at palace aside   though i am not naturally honest i am so sometimes by chance let me pocket up my pedlar 's excrement takes off his false beard how now rustics whither are you bound to the palace an it like your worship your affairs there what with whom the condition of that fardel the place of your dwelling your names your ages of what having breeding and any thing that is fitting to be known discover we are but plain fellows sir a lie you are rough and hairy let me have no lying it becomes none but tradesmen and they often give us soldiers the lie but we pay them for it with stamped coin not stabbing steel therefore they do not give us the lie your worship had like to have given us one if you had not taken yourself with the manner are you a courtier an't like you sir whether it like me or no i am a courtier seest thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings hath not my gait in it the measure of the court receives not thy nose court odor from me reflect i not on thy baseness court contempt thinkest thou for that i insinuate or toaze from thee thy business i am therefore no courtier i am courtier cap a pe and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business there whereupon i command thee to open thy affair my business sir is to the king what advocate hast thou to him i know not an't like you advocate 's the court word for a pheasant say you have none none sir i have no pheasant cock nor hen how blessed are we that are not simple men yet nature might have made me as these are therefore i will not disdain this can not be but a great courtier his garments are rich but he wears them not handsomely he seems to be the more noble in being fantastical a great man i 'll warrant i know by the picking on 's teeth the fardel there what 's i the fardel wherefore that box sir there lies such secrets in this fardel and box which none must know but the king and which he shall know within this hour if i may come to the speech of him age thou hast lost thy labour why sir the king is not at the palace he is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air himself for if thou beest capable of things serious thou must know the king is full of grief so tis said sir about his son that should have married a shepherd 's daughter if that shepherd be not in hand fast let him fly the curses he shall have the tortures he shall feel will break the back of man the heart of monster think you so sir not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter but those that are germane to him though removed fifty times shall all come under the hangman which though it be great pity yet it is necessary an old sheep whistling rogue a ram tender to offer to have his daughter come into grace some say he shall be stoned but that death is too soft for him say i \t draw our throne into a sheep cote all deaths are too few the sharpest too easy has the old man e'er a son sir do you hear an't like you sir he has a son who shall be flayed alive then nointed over with honey set on the head of a wasp 's nest then stand till he be three quarters and a dram dead then recovered again with aqua vitae or some other hot infusion then raw as he is and in the hottest day prognostication proclaims shall be be set against a brick wall the sun looking with a southward eye upon him where he is to behold him with flies blown to death but what talk we of these traitorly rascals whose miseries are to be smiled at their offences being so capital tell me for you seem to be honest plain men what you have to the king being something gently considered i 'll bring you where he is aboard tender your persons to his presence whisper him in your behalfs and if it be in man besides the king to effect your suits here is man shall do it he seems to be of great authority close with him give him gold and though authority be a stubborn bear yet he is oft led by the nose with gold show the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand and no more ado remember stoned and flayed alive an't please you sir to undertake the business for us here is that gold i have i 'll make it as much more and leave this young man in pawn till i bring it you after i have done what i promised ay sir well give me the moiety are you a party in this business in some sort sir but though my case be a pitiful one i hope i shall not be flayed out of it o that 's the case of the shepherd 's son hang him he 'll be made an example comfort good comfort we must to the king and show our strange sights he must know tis none of your daughter nor my sister we are gone else sir i will give you as much as this old man does when the business is performed and remain as he says your pawn till it be brought you i will trust you walk before toward the sea side go on the right hand i will but look upon the hedge and follow you we are blest in this man as i may say even blest let 's before as he bids us he was provided to do us good exeunt shepherd and clown if i had a mind to be honest i see fortune would not suffer me she drops booties in my mouth i am courted now with a double occasion gold and a means to do the prince my master good which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement i will bring these two moles these blind ones aboard him if he think it fit to shore them again and that the complaint they have to the king concerns him nothing let him call me rogue for being so far officious for i am proof against that title and what shame else belongs to't to him will i present them there may be matter in it exit act v scene i. a room in leontes palace enter leontes cleomenes dion paulina and servants sir you have done enough and have perform'd a saint like sorrow no fault could you make which you have not redeem'd indeed paid down more penitence than done trespass at the last do as the heavens have done forget your evil with them forgive yourself whilst i remember her and her virtues i can not forget my blemishes in them and so still think of the wrong i did myself which was so much that heirless it hath made my kingdom and destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man bred his hopes out of true too true my lord if one by one you wedded all the world or from the all that are took something good to make a perfect woman she you kill'd would be unparallel'd i think so kill'd she i kill'd i did so but thou strikest me sorely to say i did it is as bitter upon thy tongue as in my thought now good now say so but seldom not at all good lady you might have spoken a thousand things that would have done the time more benefit and graced your kindness better you are one of those would have him we d again if you would not so you pity not the state nor the remembrance of his most sovereign name consider little what dangers by his highness fail of issue may drop upon his kingdom and devour incertain lookers on what were more holy than to rejoice the former queen is well what holier than for royalty 's repair for present comfort and for future good to bless the bed of majesty again with a sweet fellow to't there is none worthy respecting her that 's gone besides the gods will have fulfill'd their secret purposes for has not the divine apollo said is't not the tenor of his oracle that king leontes shall not have an heir till his lost child be found which that it shall is all as monstrous to our human reason as my antigonus to break his grave and come again to me who on my life did perish with the infant tis your counsel my lord should to the heavens be contrary oppose against their wills to leontes care not for issue the crown will find an heir great alexander left his to the worthiest so his successor was like to be the best good paulina who hast the memory of hermione i know in honour o that ever i had squared me to thy counsel then even now i might have look'd upon my queen 's full eyes have taken treasure from her lips-- and left them more rich for what they yielded thou speak'st truth no more such wives therefore no wife one worse and better used would make her sainted spirit again possess her corpse and on this stage where we 're offenders now appear soul vex'd and begin why to me had she such power she had just cause she had and would incense me to murder her i married i should so were i the ghost that walk'd i'ld bid you mark her eye and tell me for what dull part in't you chose her then i'ld shriek that even your ears should rift to hear me and the words that follow'd should be remember mine stars stars and all eyes else dead coals fear thou no wife i 'll have no wife paulina will you swear never to marry but by my free leave never paulina so be blest my spirit then good my lords bear witness to his oath you tempt him over much unless another as like hermione as is her picture affront his eye good madam,-- i have done yet if my lord will marry,--if you will sir no remedy but you will,--give me the office to choose you a queen she shall not be so young as was your former but she shall be such as walk'd your first queen 's ghost it should take joy to see her in your arms my true paulina we shall not marry till thou bid'st us that shall be when your first queen 's again in breath never till then enter a gentleman one that gives out himself prince florizel son of polixenes with his princess she the fairest i have yet beheld desires access to your high presence what with him he comes not like to his father 's greatness his approach so out of circumstance and sudden tells us tis not a visitation framed but forced by need and accident what train but few and those but mean his princess say you with him ay the most peerless piece of earth i think that e'er the sun shone bright on o hermione as every present time doth boast itself above a better gone so must thy grave give way to what 's seen now sir you yourself have said and writ so but your writing now is colder than that theme she had not been nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse flow'd with her beauty once tis shrewdly ebb'd to say you have seen a better pardon madam the one i have almost forgot,--your pardon,-- the other when she has obtain'd your eye will have your tongue too this is a creature would she begin a sect might quench the zeal of all professors else make proselytes of who she but bid follow how not women women will love her that she is a woman more worth than any man men that she is the rarest of all women go cleomenes yourself assisted with your honour'd friends bring them to our embracement still tis strange exeunt cleomenes and others he thus should steal upon us had our prince jewel of children seen this hour he had pair'd well with this lord there was not full a month between their births prithee no more cease thou know'st he dies to me again when talk'd of sure when i shall see this gentleman thy speeches will bring me to consider that which may unfurnish me of reason they are come re enter cleomenes and others with florizel and perdita your mother was most true to wedlock prince for she did print your royal father off conceiving you were i but twenty one your father 's image is so hit in you his very air that i should call you brother as i did him and speak of something wildly by us perform'd before most dearly welcome and your fair princess,--goddess!--o alas i lost a couple that twixt heaven and earth might thus have stood begetting wonder as you gracious couple do and then i lost-- all mine own folly the society amity too of your brave father whom though bearing misery i desire my life once more to look on him by his command have i here touch'd sicilia and from him give you all greetings that a king at friend can send his brother and but infirmity which waits upon worn times hath something seized his wish'd ability he had himself the lands and waters twixt your throne and his measured to look upon you whom he loves-- he bade me say so more than all the sceptres and those that bear them living o my brother good gentleman the wrongs i have done thee stir afresh within me and these thy offices so rarely kind are as interpreters of my behind hand slackness welcome hither as is the spring to the earth and hath he too exposed this paragon to the fearful usage at least ungentle of the dreadful neptune to greet a man not worth her pains much less the adventure of her person good my lord she came from libya where the warlike smalus that noble honour'd lord is fear'd and loved most royal sir from thence from him whose daughter his tears proclaim'd his parting with her thence a prosperous south wind friendly we have cross'd to execute the charge my father gave me for visiting your highness my best train i have from your sicilian shores dismiss'd who for bohemia bend to signify not only my success in libya sir but my arrival and my wife 's in safety here where we are the blessed gods purge all infection from our air whilst you do climate here you have a holy father a graceful gentleman against whose person so sacred as it is i have done sin for which the heavens taking angry note have left me issueless and your father 's blest as he from heaven merits it with you worthy his goodness what might i have been might i a son and daughter now have look'd on such goodly things as you enter a lord most noble sir that which i shall report will bear no credit were not the proof so nigh please you great sir bohemia greets you from himself by me desires you to attach his son who has-- his dignity and duty both cast off-- fled from his father from his hopes and with a shepherd 's daughter where 's bohemia speak here in your city i now came from him i speak amazedly and it becomes my marvel and my message to your court whiles he was hastening in the chase it seems of this fair couple meets he on the way the father of this seeming lady and her brother having both their country quitted with this young prince camillo has betray'd me whose honour and whose honesty till now endured all weathers lay't so to his charge he 's with the king your father who camillo camillo sir i spake with him who now has these poor men in question never saw i wretches so quake they kneel they kiss the earth forswear themselves as often as they speak bohemia stops his ears and threatens them with divers deaths in death o my poor father the heaven sets spies upon us will not have our contract celebrated you are married we are not sir nor are we like to be the stars i see will kiss the valleys first the odds for high and low 's alike my lord is this the daughter of a king she is when once she is my wife that once i see by your good father 's speed will come on very slowly i am sorry most sorry you have broken from his liking where you were tied in duty and as sorry your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty that you might well enjoy her dear look up though fortune visible an enemy should chase us with my father power no jot hath she to change our loves beseech you sir remember since you owed no more to time than i do now with thought of such affections step forth mine advocate at your request my father will grant precious things as trifles would he do so i'ld beg your precious mistress which he counts but a trifle sir my liege your eye hath too much youth in't not a month fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes than what you look on now i thought of her even in these looks i made to florizel but your petition is yet unanswer'd i will to your father your honour not o'erthrown by your desires i am friend to them and you upon which errand i now go toward him therefore follow me and mark what way i make come good my lord exeunt scene ii before leontes palace enter autolycus and a gentleman beseech you sir were you present at this relation i was by at the opening of the fardel heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it whereupon after a little amazedness we were all commanded out of the chamber only this methought i heard the shepherd say he found the child i would most gladly know the issue of it i make a broken delivery of the business but the changes i perceived in the king and camillo were very notes of admiration they seemed almost with staring on one another to tear the cases of their eyes there was speech in their dumbness language in their very gesture they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed or one destroyed a notable passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew no more but seeing could not say if the importance were joy or sorrow but in the extremity of the one it must needs be enter another gentleman here comes a gentleman that haply knows more the news rogero nothing but bonfires the oracle is fulfilled the king 's daughter is found such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that ballad makers can not be able to express it enter a third gentleman here comes the lady paulina 's steward he can deliver you more how goes it now sir this news which is called true is so like an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion has the king found his heir most true if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance that which you hear you 'll swear you see there is such unity in the proofs the mantle of queen hermione 's her jewel about the neck of it the letters of antigonus found with it which they know to be his character the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the king 's daughter did you see the meeting of the two kings no then have you lost a sight which was to be seen can not be spoken of there might you have beheld one joy crown another so and in such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them for their joy waded in tears there was casting up of eyes holding up of hands with countenances of such distraction that they were to be known by garment not by favour our king being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter as if that joy were now become a loss cries o thy mother thy mother then asks bohemia forgiveness then embraces his son in law then again worries he his daughter with clipping her now he thanks the old shepherd which stands by like a weather bitten conduit of many kings reigns i never heard of such another encounter which lames report to follow it and undoes description to do it what pray you became of antigonus that carried hence the child like an old tale still which will have matter to rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear open he was torn to pieces with a bear this avouches the shepherd 's son who has not only his innocence which seems much to justify him but a handkerchief and rings of his that paulina knows what became of his bark and his followers wrecked the same instant of their master 's death and in the view of the shepherd so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found but o the noble combat that twixt joy and sorrow was fought in paulina she had one eye declined for the loss of her husband another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled she lifted the princess from the earth and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be in danger of losing the dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes for by such was it acted one of the prettiest touches of all and that which angled for mine eyes caught the water though not the fish was when at the relation of the queen 's death with the manner how she came to't bravely confessed and lamented by the king how attentiveness wounded his daughter till from one sign of dolour to another she did with an alas i would fain say bleed tears for i am sure my heart wept blood who was most marble there changed colour some swooned all sorrowed if all the world could have seen t the woe had been universal are they returned to the court no the princess hearing of her mother 's statue which is in the keeping of paulina,--a piece many years in doing and now newly performed by that rare italian master julio romano who had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work would beguile nature of her custom so perfectly he is her ape he so near to hermione hath done hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer thither with all greediness of affection are they gone and there they intend to sup i thought she had some great matter there in hand for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever since the death of hermione visited that removed house shall we thither and with our company piece the rejoicing who would be thence that has the benefit of access every wink of an eye some new grace will be born our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge let 's along exeunt gentlemen now had i not the dash of my former life in me would preferment drop on my head i brought the old man and his son aboard the prince told him i heard them talk of a fardel and i know not what but he at that time overfond of the shepherd 's daughter so he then took her to be who began to be much sea sick and himself little better extremity of weather continuing this mystery remained undiscovered but tis all one to me for had i been the finder out of this secret it would not have relished among my other discredits enter shepherd and clown here come those i have done good to against my will and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune come boy i am past moe children but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born you are well met sir you denied to fight with me this other day because i was no gentleman born see you these clothes say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born you were best say these robes are not gentlemen born give me the lie do and try whether i am not now a gentleman born i know you are now sir a gentleman born ay and have been so any time these four hours and so have i boy so you have but i was a gentleman born before my father for the king 's son took me by the hand and called me brother and then the two kings called my father brother and then the prince my brother and the princess my sister called my father father and so we wept and there was the first gentleman like tears that ever we shed we may live son to shed many more ay or else twere hard luck being in so preposterous estate as we are i humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the faults i have committed to your worship and to give me your good report to the prince my master prithee son do for we must be gentle now we are gentlemen thou wilt amend thy life ay an it like your good worship give me thy hand i will swear to the prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in bohemia you may say it but not swear it not swear it now i am a gentleman let boors and franklins say it i 'll swear it how if it be false son if it be ne'er so false a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend and i 'll swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk but i know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk but i 'll swear it and i would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands i will prove so sir to my power ay by any means prove a tall fellow if i do not wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk not being a tall fellow trust me not hark the kings and the princes our kindred are going to see the queen 's picture come follow us we 'll be thy good masters exeunt scene iii a chapel in paulina 's house enter leontes polixenes florizel perdita camillo paulina lords and attendants o grave and good paulina the great comfort that i have had of thee what sovereign sir i did not well i meant well all my services you have paid home but that you have vouchsafed with your crown'd brother and these your contracted heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit it is a surplus of your grace which never my life may last to answer o paulina we honour you with trouble but we came to see the statue of our queen your gallery have we pass'd through not without much content in many singularities but we saw not that which my daughter came to look upon the statue of her mother as she lived peerless so her dead likeness i do well believe excels whatever yet you look'd upon or hand of man hath done therefore i keep it lonely apart but here it is prepare to see the life as lively mock'd as ever still sleep mock'd death behold and say tis well paulina draws a curtain and discovers hermione standing like a statue i like your silence it the more shows off your wonder but yet speak first you my liege comes it not something near her natural posture chide me dear stone that i may say indeed thou art hermione or rather thou art she in thy not chiding for she was as tender as infancy and grace but yet paulina hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing so aged as this seems o not by much so much the more our carver 's excellence which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her as she lived now as now she might have done so much to my good comfort as it is now piercing to my soul o thus she stood even with such life of majesty warm life as now it coldly stands when first i woo'd her i am ashamed does not the stone rebuke me for being more stone than it o royal piece there 's magic in thy majesty which has my evils conjured to remembrance and from thy admiring daughter took the spirits standing like stone with thee and give me leave and do not say tis superstition that i kneel and then implore her blessing lady dear queen that ended when i but began give me that hand of yours to kiss o patience the statue is but newly fix'd the colour 's not dry my lord your sorrow was too sore laid on which sixteen winters can not blow away so many summers dry scarce any joy did ever so long live no sorrow but kill'd itself much sooner dear my brother let him that was the cause of this have power to take off so much grief from you as he will piece up in himself indeed my lord if i had thought the sight of my poor image would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine-- i'ld not have show'd it do not draw the curtain no longer shall you gaze on't lest your fancy may think anon it moves let be let be would i were dead but that methinks already-- what was he that did make it see my lord would you not deem it breathed and that those veins did verily bear blood masterly done the very life seems warm upon her lip the fixture of her eye has motion in't as we are mock'd with art i 'll draw the curtain my lord 's almost so far transported that he 'll think anon it lives o sweet paulina make me to think so twenty years together no settled senses of the world can match the pleasure of that madness let t alone i am sorry sir i have thus far stirr'd you but i could afflict you farther do paulina for this affliction has a taste as sweet as any cordial comfort still methinks there is an air comes from her what fine chisel could ever yet cut breath let no man mock me for i will kiss her good my lord forbear the ruddiness upon her lip is wet you 'll mar it if you kiss it stain your own with oily painting shall i draw the curtain no not these twenty years so long could i stand by a looker on either forbear quit presently the chapel or resolve you for more amazement if you can behold it i 'll make the statue move indeed descend and take you by the hand but then you 'll think-- which i protest against i am assisted by wicked powers what you can make her do i am content to look on what to speak i am content to hear for tis as easy to make her speak as move it is required you do awake your faith then all stand still on those that think it is unlawful business i am about let them depart proceed no foot shall stir music awake her strike music tis time descend be stone no more approach strike all that look upon with marvel come i 'll fill your grave up stir nay come away bequeath to death your numbness for from him dear life redeems you you perceive she stirs hermione comes down start not her actions shall be holy as you hear my spell is lawful do not shun her until you see her die again for then you kill her double nay present your hand when she was young you woo'd her now in age is she become the suitor o she 's warm if this be magic let it be an art lawful as eating she embraces him she hangs about his neck if she pertain to life let her speak too ay and make't manifest where she has lived or how stolen from the dead that she is

you farther my brother and thy uncle call'd antonio-- i pray thee mark me that a brother should be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself of all the world i loved and to him put the manage of my state as at that time through all the signories it was the first and prospero the prime duke being so reputed in dignity and for the liberal arts without a parallel those being all my study the government i cast upon my brother and to my state grew stranger being transported and rapt in secret studies thy false uncle-- dost thou attend me sir most heedfully being once perfected how to grant suits how to deny them who to advance and who to trash for over topping new created the creatures that were mine i say or changed 'em or else new form'd 'em having both the key of officer and office set all hearts

worldly ends all dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind with that which but by being so retired o'er prized all popular rate in my false brother awaked an evil nature and my trust like a good parent did beget of him a falsehood in its contrary as great as my trust was which had indeed no limit a confidence sans bound he being thus lorded not only with what my revenue yielded but what my power might else exact like one who having into truth by telling of it made such a sinner of his memory to credit his own lie he did believe he was indeed the duke out o the substitution and executing the outward face of royalty with all prerogative hence his ambition growing-- dost thou hear your tale sir would cure deafness to have no screen between this part he play'd and him he play'd it for he needs will be absolute milan me poor man my library was dukedom large enough of temporal royalties he thinks me now incapable confederates-- so dry he was for sway wi the king of naples to give him annual tribute do him homage subject his coronet to his crown and bend the dukedom yet unbow'd alas poor milan!-- to most ignoble stooping o the heavens mark his condition and the event then tell me if this might be a brother i should sin to think but nobly of my grandmother good wombs have borne bad sons now the condition the king of naples being an enemy to me inveterate hearkens my brother 's suit which was that he in lieu o the premises of homage and i know not how much tribute should presently extirpate me and mine out of the dukedom and confer fair milan with all the honours on my brother whereon a treacherous army levied one midnight fated to the purpose did antonio open the gates of milan and i the dead of darkness the ministers for the purpose hurried thence me and thy crying self alack for pity i not remembering how i cried out then will cry it o'er again it is a hint that wrings mine eyes to't hear a little further and then i 'll bring thee to the present business which now 's upon 's without the which this story were most impertinent wherefore did they not that hour destroy us well demanded wench my tale provokes that question dear they durst not so dear the love my people bore me nor set a mark so bloody on the business but with colours fairer painted their foul ends in few they hurried us aboard a bark bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared a rotten carcass of a boat not rigg'd nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats instinctively had quit it there they hoist us to cry to the sea that roar'd to us to sigh to the winds whose pity sighing back again did us but loving wrong alack what trouble was i then to you o a cherubim thou wast that did preserve me thou didst smile infused with a fortitude from heaven when i have deck'd the sea with drops full salt under my burthen groan'd which raised in me an undergoing stomach to bear up against what should ensue how came we ashore by providence divine some food we had and some fresh water that a noble neapolitan gonzalo out of his charity being then appointed master of this design did give us with rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries which since have steaded much so of his

troops i have dispersed them 'bout the isle the king 's son have i landed by himself whom i left cooling of the air with sighs in an odd angle of the isle and sitting his arms in this sad knot of the king 's ship the mariners say how thou hast disposed and all the rest o the fleet safely in harbour is the king 's ship in the deep nook where once thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew from the still vex'd bermoothes there she 's hid the mariners all under hatches stow'd who with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour i have left asleep and for the rest o the fleet which i dispersed

island enter alonso sebastian antonio gonzalo adrian francisco and others beseech you sir be merry you have cause so have we all of joy for our escape is much beyond our loss our hint of woe is common every day some sailor 's wife the masters of some merchant and the merchant have just our theme of woe but for the miracle i mean our preservation few in millions can speak like us then wisely good sir weigh our sorrow with our comfort prithee peace he receives comfort like cold porridge the visitor will not give him o'er so look he 's winding up the watch of his wit by and by it will strike sir,-- one tell when every grief is entertain'd that 's offer'd comes to the entertainer-- a dollar dolour comes to him indeed you have spoken truer than you purposed you have taken it wiselier than i meant you should therefore my lord,-- fie what a spendthrift is he of his tongue i prithee spare well i have done but yet,-- he will be talking which of he or adrian for a good wager first begins to crow the old cock the cockerel done the wager a laughter a match though this island seem to be desert,-- ha ha ha so you 're paid uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,-- yet,-- yet,-- he could not miss't it must needs be of subtle tender and delicate temperance temperance was a delicate wench ay and a subtle as he most learnedly delivered the air breathes upon us here most sweetly as if it had lungs and rotten ones or as twere perfumed by a fen here is everything advantageous to life true save means to live of that there 's none or little how lush and lusty the grass looks how green the ground indeed is tawny with an eye of green in't he misses not much no he doth but mistake the truth totally but the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost beyond credit,-- as many vouched rarities are that our garments being as they were drenched in the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses being rather new dyed than stained with salt water if but one of his pockets could speak would it not say he lies ay or very falsely pocket up his report methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in afric at the marriage of the king 's fair daughter claribel to the king of tunis twas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in our return tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen not since widow dido 's time widow a pox o that how came that widow in widow dido what if he had said widower aeneas too good lord how you take it widow dido said you you make me study of that she was of carthage not of tunis this tunis sir was carthage carthage i assure you carthage his word is more than the miraculous harp he hath raised the wall and houses too what impossible matter will he make easy next i think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple and sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring forth more islands ay why in good time sir we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at tunis at the marriage of your daughter who is now queen and the rarest that e'er came there bate i beseech you widow dido o widow dido ay widow dido is not sir my doublet as fresh as the first day i wore it i mean in a sort that sort was well fished for when i wore it at your daughter 's marriage you cram these words into mine ears against the stomach of my sense would i had never married my daughter there for coming thence my son is lost and in my rate she too who is so far from italy removed i ne'er again shall see her o thou mine heir of naples and of milan what strange fish hath made his meal on thee sir he may live i saw him beat the surges under him and ride upon their backs he trod the water whose enmity he flung aside and breasted the surge most swoln that met him his bold head bove the contentious waves he kept and oar'd himself with his good arms in lusty stroke to the shore that o'er his wave worn basis bow'd as stooping to relieve him i not doubt he came alive to land no no he 's gone sir you may thank yourself for this great loss that would not bless our europe with your daughter but rather lose her to an african where she at least is banish'd from your eye who hath cause to wet the grief on't prithee peace you were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise by all of us and the fair soul herself weigh'd between loathness and obedience at which end o the beam should bow we have lost your son i fear for ever milan and naples have more widows in them of this business making than we bring men to comfort them the fault 's your own so is the dear'st o the loss my lord sebastian the truth you speak doth lack some gentleness and time to speak it in you rub the sore when you should bring the plaster very well and most chirurgeonly it is foul weather in us all good sir when you are cloudy foul weather very foul had i plantation of this isle my lord,-- he'ld sow't with nettle seed or docks or mallows and were the king on't what would i do scape being drunk for want of wine i the commonwealth i would by contraries execute all things for no kind of traffic would i admit no name of magistrate letters should not be known riches poverty and use of service none contract succession bourn bound of land tilth vineyard none no use of metal corn or wine or oil no occupation all men idle all and women too but innocent and pure no sovereignty;-- yet he would be king on't the latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning all things in common nature should produce without sweat or endeavour treason felony sword pike knife gun or need of any engine would i not have but nature should bring forth of its own kind all foison all abundance to feed my innocent people no marrying mong his subjects none man all idle whores and knaves i would with such perfection govern sir to excel the golden age god save his majesty long live gonzalo and,--do you mark me sir prithee no more thou dost talk nothing to me i do well believe your highness and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing twas you we laughed at who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you so you may continue and laugh at nothing still what a blow was there given an it had not fallen flat long you are gentlemen of brave metal you would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing enter ariel invisible playing solemn music we would so and then go a bat fowling nay good my lord be not angry no i warrant you i will not adventure my discretion so weakly will you laugh me asleep for i am very heavy go sleep and hear us all sleep except alonso sebastian and antonio what all so soon asleep i wish mine eyes would with themselves shut up my

not myself disposed to sleep nor i my spirits are nimble they fell together all as by consent they dropp'd as by a thunder stroke what might worthy sebastian o what might?--no more:-- and yet me thinks i see it in thy face what thou shouldst be the occasion speaks thee and my strong imagination sees a crown dropping upon thy head what art thou waking do you not hear me speak i do and surely it is a sleepy language and thou speak'st out of thy sleep what is it thou didst say this is a strange repose to be asleep with eyes wide open standing speaking moving and yet so fast asleep noble sebastian thou let'st thy fortune sleep die rather wink'st whiles thou art waking thou dost snore distinctly there 's meaning in thy snores i am more serious than my custom you must be so too if heed me which to do trebles thee o'er well i am standing water i 'll teach you how to flow do so to ebb hereditary sloth instructs me o if you but knew how you the purpose cherish whiles thus you mock it how in stripping it you more invest it ebbing men indeed most often do so near the bottom run by their own fear or sloth prithee say on the setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim a matter from thee and a birth indeed which throes thee much to yield thus sir although this lord of weak remembrance this who shall be of as little memory when he is earth'd hath here almost persuade,-- for he 's a spirit of persuasion only professes to persuade,--the king his son 's alive tis as impossible that he 's undrown'd and he that sleeps here swims i have no hope that he 's undrown'd o out of that no hope what great hope have you no hope that way is another way so high a hope that even ambition can not pierce a wink beyond but doubt discovery there will you grant with me that ferdinand is drown'd he 's gone then tell me who 's the next heir of naples claribel she that is queen of tunis she that dwells ten leagues beyond man 's life she that from naples can have no note unless the sun were

remove some thousands of these logs and pile them up upon a sore injunction my sweet mistress weeps when she sees me work and says such baseness had never like executor i forget but these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours most busy lest when i do it enter miranda and prospero at a distance unseen alas now pray you work not so hard i would the lightning had burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile pray set it down and rest you when this burns twill weep for having wearied you my father is hard at study pray now rest yourself he 's safe for these three hours o most dear mistress the sun will set before i shall discharge what i must strive to do if you 'll sit down i 'll bear your logs the while pray give me that i 'll carry it to the pile no precious creature i had

have eyed with best regard and many a time the harmony of their tongues hath into bondage brought my too diligent ear for several virtues have i liked several women never any with so fun soul but some defect in her did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed and put it to the foil but you o you so perfect and so peerless are created of every creature 's best i do not know one of my sex no woman 's face remember save from my glass mine own nor have i seen more that i may call men than you good friend and my dear father how features are abroad i am skilless of but by my modesty the jewel in my dower i would not wish any companion in the world but you nor can imagination form a shape besides yourself to like of but i prattle something too wildly and my father 's precepts i therein do forget i am in my condition a prince miranda i do think a king i would not so!--and would no more endure this wooden slavery than to suffer the flesh fly blow my mouth hear my soul speak the very instant that i saw you did my heart fly to your service there resides to make me slave to it and for your sake am i this patient log man do you love me o heaven o earth bear witness to this sound and crown what i profess with kind event if i speak true if hollowly invert what best is boded me to mischief i beyond all limit of what else i the world do love prize honour you i am a fool to weep at what i am glad of fair encounter of two most rare affections heavens rain grace on that which breeds between 'em wherefore weep you at mine unworthiness that dare not offer what i desire to give and much less take what i shall die to want but this is trifling and all the more it seeks to hide itself the bigger bulk it shows hence bashful cunning and prompt me plain and holy innocence i am your wife if you will marry me if not i 'll die your maid to be your fellow you may deny me but i 'll be your servant whether you will or no my mistress dearest and i thus humble ever my husband then ay with a heart as willing as bondage e'er of freedom here 's my hand and mine with my heart in't and now farewell till half an hour hence a thousand thousand exeunt ferdinand and miranda severally so glad of

he 's but a sot as i am nor hath not one spirit to command they all do hate him as rootedly as i. burn but his books he has brave utensils,--for so he calls them-- which when he has a house he 'll deck withal and that most deeply to consider is the beauty of his daughter he himself calls her a nonpareil i never saw a woman but only sycorax my dam and she but she as far surpasseth sycorax as great'st does least is it so brave a lass ay lord she will become thy bed i warrant and bring thee forth brave brood monster i will kill this man his daughter and i will be king and queen save our graces!--and trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys dost thou like the plot trinculo excellent give me thy hand i am sorry i beat thee but while thou livest keep a good tongue in thy head within this

not sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about mine ears and sometime voices that if i then had waked after long sleep will make me sleep again and then in dreaming the clouds methought would open and show riches ready to drop upon me that when i waked i cried to dream again this will prove a brave kingdom to me where i shall have my music for nothing when prospero is destroyed that

remember-- for that 's my business to you that you three from milan did supplant good prospero exposed unto the sea which hath requit it him and his innocent child for which foul deed the powers delaying not forgetting have incensed the seas and shores yea all the creatures against your peace thee of thy son alonso they have bereft and do pronounce by me lingering perdition worse than any

peers of england pillars of the state to you duke humphrey must unload his grief your grief the common grief of all the land what did my brother henry spend his youth his valour coin and people in the wars did he so often lodge in open field in winter 's cold and summer 's parching heat to conquer france his true inheritance and did my brother bedford toil his wits to keep by policy what henry got have you yourselves somerset buckingham brave york salisbury and victorious warwick received deep scars in france and normandy or hath mine uncle beaufort and myself with all the learned council of the realm studied so long sat in the council house early and late debating to and fro how france and frenchmen might be kept in awe and had his highness in his infancy crowned in paris in despite of foes and shall these labours and these honours die shall henry 's conquest bedford 's vigilance your deeds of war and all our counsel die o peers of england shameful is this league fatal this marriage cancelling your fame blotting your names from books of memory razing the characters of your renown defacing monuments of conquer'd france undoing all as all had never been nephew what means this passionate discourse this peroration with such circumstance for france tis ours and we will keep it still ay uncle we will keep it if we can but now it is impossible we should suffolk the new made duke that rules the roast hath given the duchy of anjou and maine unto the poor king reignier whose large style agrees not with the leanness of his purse now by the death of him that died for all these counties were the keys of normandy but wherefore weeps warwick my valiant son for grief that they are past recovery for were there hope to conquer them again my sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears anjou and maine myself did win them both those provinces these arms of mine did conquer and are the cities that i got with wounds delivered up again with peaceful words mort dieu for suffolk 's duke may he be suffocate that dims the honour of this warlike isle france should have torn and rent my very heart before i would have yielded to this league i never read but england 's kings have had large sums of gold and dowries with their wives and our king henry gives away his own to match with her that brings no vantages a proper jest and never heard before that suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth for costs and charges in transporting her she should have stayed in france and starved in france before-- my lord of gloucester now ye grow too hot it was the pleasure of my lord the king my lord of winchester i know your mind tis not my speeches that you do mislike but tis my presence that doth trouble ye rancour will out proud prelate in thy face i see thy fury if i longer stay we shall begin our ancient bickerings lordings farewell and say when i am gone i prophesied france will be lost ere long exit so there goes our protector in a rage tis known to you he is mine enemy nay more an enemy unto you all and no great friend i fear me to the king consider lords he is the next of blood and heir apparent to the english crown had henry got an empire by his marriage and all the wealthy kingdoms of the west there 's reason he should be displeased at it look to it lords let not his smoothing words bewitch your hearts be wise and circumspect what though the common people favour him calling him humphrey the good duke of gloucester clapping their hands and crying with loud voice jesu maintain your royal excellence with god preserve the good duke humphrey i fear me lords for all this flattering gloss he will be found a dangerous protector why should he then protect our sovereign he being of age to govern of himself cousin of somerset join you with me and all together with the duke of suffolk we 'll quickly hoise duke humphrey from his seat this weighty business will not brook delay i 'll to the duke of suffolk presently exit cousin of buckingham though humphrey 's pride and greatness of his place be grief to us yet let us watch the haughty cardinal his insolence is more intolerable than all the princes in the land beside if gloucester be displaced he 'll be protector or thou or i somerset will be protector despite duke humphrey or the cardinal exeunt buckingham and somerset pride went before ambition follows him while these do labour for their own preferment behoves it us to labour for the realm i never saw but humphrey duke of gloucester did bear him like a noble gentleman oft have i seen the haughty cardinal more like a soldier than a man o the church as stout and proud as he were lord of all swear like a ruffian and demean himself unlike the ruler of a commonweal warwick my son the comfort of my age thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping hath won the greatest favour of the commons excepting none but good duke humphrey and brother york thy acts in ireland in bringing them to civil discipline thy late exploits done in the heart of france when thou wert regent for our sovereign have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people join we together for the public good in what we can to bridle and suppress the pride of suffolk and the cardinal with somerset 's and buckingham 's ambition and as we may cherish duke humphrey 's deeds while they do tend the profit of the land so god help warwick as he loves the land and common profit of his country aside   and so says york for he hath greatest cause then let 's make haste away and look unto the main unto the main o father maine is lost that maine which by main force warwick did win and would have kept so long as breath did last main chance father you meant but i meant maine which i will win from france or else be slain exeunt warwick and salisbury anjou and maine are given to the french paris is lost the state of normandy stands on a tickle point now they are gone suffolk concluded on the articles the peers agreed and henry was well pleased to change two dukedoms for a duke 's fair daughter i can not blame them all what is't to them tis thine they give away and not their own pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage and purchase friends and give to courtezans still revelling like lords till all be gone while as the silly owner of the goods weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands and shakes his head and trembling stands aloof while all is shared and all is borne away ready to starve and dare not touch his own so york must sit and fret and bite his tongue while his own lands are bargain'd for and sold methinks the realms of england france and ireland bear that proportion to my flesh and blood as did the fatal brand althaea burn'd unto the prince 's heart of calydon anjou and maine both given unto the french cold news for me for i had hope of france even as i have of fertile england 's soil a day will come when york shall claim his own and therefore i will take the nevils parts and make a show of love to proud duke humphrey and when i spy advantage claim the crown for that 's the golden mark i seek to hit nor shall proud lancaster usurp my right nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist nor wear the diadem upon his head whose church like humours fits not for a crown then york be still awhile till time do serve watch thou and wake when others be asleep to pry into the secrets of the state till henry surfeiting in joys of love with his new bride and england 's dear bought queen and humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars then will i raise aloft the milk white rose with whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed and in my standard bear the arms of york to grapple with the house of lancaster and force perforce i 'll make him yield the crown whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair england down exit scene ii gloucester 's house enter gloucester and his duchess why droops my lord like over ripen'd corn hanging the head at ceres plenteous load why doth the great duke humphrey knit his brows as frowning at the favours of the world why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight what seest thou there king henry 's diadem enchased with all the honours of the world if so gaze on and grovel on thy face until thy head be circled with the same put forth thy hand reach at the glorious gold what is't too short i 'll lengthen it with mine and having both

the canker of ambitious thoughts and may that thought when i imagine ill against my king and nephew virtuous henry be my last breathing in this mortal world my troublous dream this night doth make me sad what dream'd my lord tell me and i 'll requite it with sweet rehearsal of my morning 's dream methought this staff mine office badge in court was broke in twain by whom i have forgot but as i think it was by the cardinal and on the pieces of the broken wand were placed the heads of edmund duke of somerset and william de la pole first duke of suffolk this was my dream what it doth bode god knows tut this was nothing but an argument that he that breaks a stick of gloucester 's grove shall lose his head for his presumption but list to me my humphrey my sweet duke methought i sat in seat of majesty in the cathedral church of westminster and in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd where henry and dame margaret kneel'd to me and on my head did set the diadem nay eleanor then

sure whose rightful cause prevails flourish exeunt scene ii london york 's garden enter york salisbury and warwick now my good lords of salisbury and warwick our simple supper ended give me leave in this close walk to satisfy myself in craving your opinion of my title which is infallible to england 's crown my lord i long to hear it at full sweet york begin and if thy claim be good the nevils are thy subjects to command then thus edward the third my lords had seven sons the first edward the black prince prince of wales the second william of hatfield and the third lionel duke of clarence next to whom was john of gaunt the duke of lancaster the fifth was edmund langley duke of york the sixth was thomas of woodstock duke of gloucester william of windsor was the seventh and last edward the black prince died before his father and left behind him richard his only son who after edward the third 's death reign'd as king till henry bolingbroke duke of lancaster the eldest son and heir of john of gaunt crown'd by the name of henry the fourth seized on the realm deposed the rightful king sent his poor queen to france from whence she came and him to pomfret where as all you know harmless richard was murder'd traitorously father the duke hath told the truth thus got the house of lancaster the crown which now they hold by force and not by right for richard the first son 's heir being dead the issue of the next son should have reign'd but william of hatfield died without an heir the third son duke of clarence from whose line i claimed the crown had issue philippe a daughter who married edmund mortimer earl of march edmund had issue roger earl of march roger had issue edmund anne and eleanor this edmund in the reign of bolingbroke as i have read laid claim unto the crown and but for owen glendower had been king who kept him in captivity till he died but to the rest his eldest sister anne my mother being heir unto the crown married richard earl of cambridge who was son to edmund langley edward the third 's fifth son by her i claim the kingdom she was heir to roger earl of march who was the son of edmund mortimer who married philippe sole daughter unto lionel duke of clarence so if the issue of the elder son succeed before the younger i am king what plain proceeding is more plain than this henry doth claim the crown from john of gaunt the fourth son york claims it from the third till lionel 's issue fails his should not reign it fails not yet but flourishes in thee and in thy sons fair slips of such a stock then father salisbury kneel we together and in this private plot be we the first that shall salute our rightful sovereign with honour of his birthright to the crown long live our sovereign richard england 's king we thank you lords but i am not your

strangeness of his alter'd countenance with what a majesty he bears himself how insolent of late he is become how proud how peremptory and unlike himself we know the time since he was mild and affable and if we did but glance a far off look immediately he was upon his knee that all the court admired him for submission but meet him now and be it in the morn when every one will give the time of day he knits his brow and shows an angry eye and passeth by with stiff unbowed knee disdaining duty that to us belongs small curs are not regarded when they grin but great men tremble when the lion roars and humphrey is no little man in england first note that he is near you in descent and should you fall he as the next will mount me seemeth then it is no policy respecting what a rancorous mind he bears and his advantage following your decease that he should come about your royal person or be admitted to your highness council by flattery hath he won the commons hearts and when he please to make

the king he was successive heir and such high vaunts of his nobility did instigate the bedlam brain sick duchess by wicked means to frame our sovereign 's fall smooth runs the water where the brook is deep and in his simple show he harbours treason the fox barks not when he would steal the lamb no no my sovereign gloucester is a man unsounded yet and full of deep deceit did he not contrary to form of law devise strange deaths for small offences done and did he not in his protectorship levy great sums of money through the realm for soldiers pay in france and never sent it by means whereof the towns each day revolted tut these are petty faults to faults unknown which time will bring to light in smooth duke humphrey my lords at once the care you have of us to mow down thorns that would annoy our foot is worthy praise but shall i speak my conscience our kinsman gloucester is as innocent from meaning treason to our royal person as is the sucking lamb or harmless dove the duke is virtuous mild and too well given to dream on evil or to work my downfall ah what 's more dangerous than this fond affiance seems he a dove his feathers are but borrowed for he 's disposed as the hateful raven is he a lamb his skin is surely lent him for he 's inclined as is the ravenous wolf who can not steal a shape that means deceit take heed my lord the welfare of us all hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man enter somerset all health unto my gracious sovereign welcome lord somerset what news from france that all your interest in those territories is utterly bereft you all is lost cold news lord somerset but god 's will be done aside   cold news for me for i had hope of france as firmly as i hope for fertile england thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud and caterpillars eat my leaves away but i will remedy this gear ere long or sell my title for a glorious grave enter gloucester all happiness unto my lord the king pardon my liege that i have stay'd so long nay gloucester know that thou art come too soon unless thou wert more loyal than thou art i do arrest thee of high treason here well suffolk thou shalt not see me blush nor change my countenance for this arrest a heart unspotted is not easily daunted the purest spring is not so free from mud as i am clear from treason to my sovereign who can accuse me wherein am i guilty tis thought my lord that you took bribes of france and being protector stayed the soldiers pay by means whereof his highness hath lost france is it but thought so what are they that think it i never robb'd the soldiers of their pay nor ever had one penny bribe from france so help me god as i have watch'd the night ay night by night in studying good for england that doit that e'er i wrested from the king or any groat i hoarded to my use be brought against me at my trial day no many a pound of mine own proper store because i would not tax the needy commons have i disbursed to the garrisons and never ask'd for restitution it serves you well my lord to say so much i say no more than truth so help me god in your protectorship you did devise strange tortures for offenders never heard of that england was defamed by tyranny why tis well known that whiles i was protector pity was all the fault that was in me for i should melt at an offender 's tears and lowly words were ransom for their fault unless it were a bloody murderer or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers i never gave them condign punishment murder indeed that bloody sin i tortured above the felon or what trespass else my lord these faults are easy quickly answered but mightier crimes are laid unto your charge whereof you can not easily purge yourself i do arrest you in his highness name and here commit you to my lord cardinal to keep until your further time of trial my lord of gloucester tis my special hope that you will clear yourself from all suspect my conscience tells me you are innocent ah gracious lord these days are dangerous virtue is choked with foul ambition and charity chased hence by rancour 's hand foul subornation is predominant and equity exiled your highness land i know their complot is to have my life and if my death might make this island happy and prove the period of their tyranny i would expend it with all willingness but mine is made the prologue to their play for thousands more that yet suspect no peril will not conclude their plotted tragedy beaufort 's red sparkling eyes blab his heart 's malice and suffolk 's cloudy brow his stormy hate sharp buckingham unburthens with his tongue the envious load that lies upon his heart and dogged york that reaches at the moon whose overweening arm i have pluck'd back by false accuse doth level at my life and you my sovereign lady with the rest causeless have laid disgraces on my head and with your best endeavour have stirr'd up my liefest liege to be mine enemy ay all you have laid your heads together-- myself had notice of your conventicles-- and all to make away my guiltless life i shall not want false witness to condemn me nor store of treasons to augment my guilt the ancient proverb will be well effected a staff is quickly found to beat a dog my liege his railing is intolerable if those that care to keep your royal person from treason 's secret knife and traitors rage be thus upbraided chid and rated at and the offender granted scope of speech twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace hath he not twit our sovereign lady here with ignominious words though clerkly couch'd as if she had suborned some to swear false allegations to o'erthrow his state but i can give the loser leave to chide far truer spoke than meant i lose indeed beshrew the winners for they play'd me false and well such losers may have leave to speak he 'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day lord cardinal he is your prisoner sirs take away the duke and guard him sure ah thus king henry throws away his crutch before his legs be firm to bear his body thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side and wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first ah that my fear were false ah that it were for good king henry thy decay i fear exit guarded my lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best do or undo as if ourself were here what will your highness leave the parliament ay margaret my heart is drown'd with grief whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes my body round engirt with misery for what 's more miserable than discontent ah uncle humphrey in thy face i see the map of honour truth and loyalty and yet good humphrey is the hour to come that e'er i proved thee false or fear'd thy faith what louring star now envies thy estate that these great lords and margaret our queen do seek subversion of thy harmless life thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong and as the butcher takes away the calf and binds the wretch and beats it when it strays bearing it to the bloody slaughter house even so remorseless have they borne him hence and as the dam runs lowing up and down looking the way her harmless young one went and can do nought but wail her darling 's loss even so myself bewails good gloucester 's case with sad unhelpful tears and with dimm'd eyes look after him and can not do him good so mighty are his vowed enemies his fortunes i will weep and twixt each groan say who 's a traitor gloucester he is none exeunt all but queen margaret cardinal suffolk and york somerset remains apart free lords cold snow melts with the sun 's hot beams henry my lord is cold in great affairs too full of foolish pity and gloucester 's show beguiles him as the mournful crocodile with sorrow snares relenting passengers or as the snake roll'd in a flowering bank with shining chequer'd slough doth sting a child that for the beauty thinks it excellent believe me lords were none more wise than i-- and yet herein i judge mine own wit good-- this gloucester should be quickly rid the world to rid us of the fear we have of him that he should die is worthy policy but yet we want a colour for his death tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law but in my mind that were no policy the king will labour still to save his life the commons haply rise to save his life and yet we have but trivial argument more than mistrust that shows him worthy death so that by this you would not have him die ah york no man alive so fain as i tis york that hath more reason for his death but my lord cardinal and you my lord of suffolk say as you think and speak it from your souls were't not all one an empty eagle were set to guard the chicken from a hungry kite as place duke humphrey for the king 's protector so the poor chicken should be sure of death madam tis true and were't not madness then to make the fox surveyor of the fold who being accused a crafty murderer his guilt should be but idly posted over because his purpose is not executed no let him die in that he is a fox by nature proved an enemy to the flock before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood as humphrey proved by reasons to my liege and do not stand on quillets how to slay him be it by gins by snares by subtlety sleeping or waking tis no matter how so he be dead for that is good deceit which mates him first that first intends deceit thrice noble suffolk tis resolutely spoke not resolute except so much were done for things are often spoke and seldom meant but that my heart accordeth with my tongue seeing the deed is meritorious and to preserve my sovereign from his foe say but the word and i will be his priest but i would have him dead my lord of suffolk ere you can take due orders for a priest say you consent and censure well the deed and i 'll provide his executioner i tender so the safety of my liege here is my hand the deed is worthy doing and so say i. and i     and now we three have spoke it it skills not greatly who impugns our doom enter a post great lords from ireland am i come amain to signify that rebels there are up and put the englishmen unto the sword send succors lords and stop the rage betime before the wound do grow uncurable for being green there is great hope of help a breach that craves a quick expedient stop what counsel give you in this weighty cause that somerset be sent as regent thither tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd witness the fortune he hath had in france if york with all his far fet policy had been the regent there instead of me he never would have stay'd in france so long no not to lose it all as thou hast done i rather would have lost my life betimes than bring a burthen of dishonour home by staying there so long till all were lost show me one scar character'd on thy skin men 's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win nay then this spark will prove a raging fire if wind and fuel be brought to feed it with no more good york sweet somerset be still thy fortune york hadst thou been regent there might happily have proved far worse than his what worse than nought nay then a shame take all and in the number thee that wishest shame my lord of york try what your fortune is the uncivil kerns of ireland are in arms and temper clay with blood of englishmen to ireland will you lead a band of men collected choicely from each county some and try your hap against the irishmen i will my lord so please his majesty why our authority is his consent and what we do establish he confirms then noble york take thou this task in hand i am content provide me soldiers lords whiles i take order for mine own affairs a charge lord york that i will see perform'd but now return we to the false duke humphrey no more of him for i will deal with him that henceforth he shall trouble us no more and so break off the day is almost spent lord suffolk you and i must talk of that event my lord of suffolk within fourteen days at bristol i expect my soldiers for there i 'll ship them all for ireland i 'll see it truly done my lord of york exeunt all but york now york or never steel thy fearful thoughts and change misdoubt to resolution be that thou hopest to be or what thou art resign to death it is not worth the enjoying let pale faced fear keep with the mean born man and find no harbour in a royal heart faster than spring time showers comes thought on thought and not a thought but thinks on dignity my brain more busy than the labouring spider weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies well nobles well tis politicly done to send me packing with an host of men i fear me you but warm the starved snake who cherish'd in your breasts will sting your hearts twas men i lack'd and you will give them me i take it kindly and yet be well assured you put sharp weapons in a madman 's hands whiles i in ireland nourish a mighty band i will stir up in england some black storm shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell and this fell tempest shall not cease to rage until the golden circuit on my head like to the glorious sun 's transparent beams do calm the fury of this mad bred flaw and for a minister of my intent i have seduced a headstrong kentishman john cade of ashford to make commotion as full well he can under the title of john mortimer in ireland have i seen this stubborn cade oppose himself against a troop of kerns and fought so long till that his thighs with darts were almost like a sharp quill'd porpentine and in the end being rescued i have seen him caper upright like a wild morisco shaking the bloody darts as he his bells full often like a shag hair'd crafty kern hath he conversed with the enemy and undiscover'd come to me again and given me notice of their villanies this devil here shall be my substitute for that john mortimer which now is dead in face in gait in speech he doth resemble by this i shall perceive the commons mind how they affect the house and claim of york say he be taken rack'd and tortured i know no pain they can inflict upon him will make him say i moved him to those arms say that he thrive as tis great like he will why then from ireland come i with my strength and reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd for humphrey being dead as he shall be and henry put apart the next for me exit scene ii bury st edmund 's a room of state enter certain murderers hastily run to my lord of suffolk let him know we have dispatch'd the duke as he commanded o that it were to do what have we done didst ever hear a man so penitent enter suffolk here comes my lord now sirs have you dispatch'd this thing ay my good lord he 's dead why that 's well said go get you to my house i will reward you for this venturous deed the king and all the peers are here at hand have you laid fair the bed is all things well according as i gave directions tis my good lord away be gone exeunt murderers sound trumpets enter king henry vi queen margaret cardinal somerset with attendants go call our uncle to our presence straight say we intend to try his grace to day if he be guilty as tis published i 'll call him presently my noble lord exit lords take your places and i pray you all proceed no straiter gainst our uncle gloucester than from true evidence of good esteem he be approved in practise culpable god forbid any malice should prevail that faultless may condemn a nobleman pray god he may acquit him of suspicion i thank thee meg these words content me much re enter suffolk how now why look'st thou pale why tremblest thou where is our uncle what 's the matter suffolk dead in his bed my lord gloucester is dead marry god forfend god 's secret judgment i did dream to night the duke was dumb and could not speak a word king henry vi swoons how fares my lord help lords the king is dead rear up his body wring him by the nose run go help help o henry ope thine eyes he doth revive again madam be patient o heavenly god how fares my gracious lord comfort my sovereign gracious henry comfort what doth my lord of suffolk comfort me came he right now to sing a raven 's note whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers and thinks he that the chirping of a wren by crying comfort from a hollow breast can chase away the first conceived sound hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words lay not thy hands on me forbear i say their touch affrights me as a serpent 's sting thou baleful messenger out of my sight upon thy eye balls murderous tyranny sits in grim majesty to fright the world look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding yet do not go away come basilisk and kill the innocent gazer with thy sight for in the shade of death i shall find joy in life but double death now gloucester 's dead why do you rate my lord of suffolk thus although the duke was enemy to him yet he most christian like laments his death and for myself foe as he was to me might liquid tears or heart offending groans or blood consuming sighs recall his life i would be blind with weeping sick with groans look pale as primrose with blood drinking sighs and all to have the noble duke alive what know i how the world may deem of me for it is known we were but hollow friends it may be judged i made the duke away so shall my name with slander 's tongue be wounded and princes courts be fill'd with my reproach this get i by his death ay me unhappy to be a queen and crown'd with infamy ah woe is me for gloucester wretched man be woe for me more wretched than he is what dost thou turn away and hide thy face i am no loathsome leper look on me what art thou like the adder waxen deaf be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen is all thy comfort shut in gloucester 's tomb why then dame margaret was ne'er thy joy erect his statue and worship it and make my image but an alehouse sign was i for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea and twice by awkward wind from england 's bank drove back again unto my native clime what boded this but well forewarning wind did seem to say seek not a scorpion 's nest nor set no footing on this unkind shore what did i then but cursed the gentle gusts and he that loosed them forth their brazen caves and bid them blow towards england 's blessed shore or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock yet aeolus would not be a murderer but left that hateful office unto thee the pretty vaulting sea refused to drown me knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore with tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness the splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands and would not dash me with their ragged sides because thy flinty heart more hard than they might in thy palace perish margaret as far as i could ken thy chalky cliffs when from thy shore the tempest beat us back i stood upon the hatches in the storm and when the dusky sky began to rob my earnest gaping sight of thy land 's view i took a costly jewel from my neck a heart it was bound in with diamonds and threw it towards thy land the sea received it and so i wish'd thy body might my heart and even with this i lost fair england 's view and bid mine eyes be packing with my heart and call'd them blind and dusky spectacles for losing ken of albion 's wished coast how often have i tempted suffolk 's tongue the agent of thy foul inconstancy to sit and witch me as ascanius did when he to madding dido would unfold his father 's acts commenced in burning troy am i not witch'd like her or thou not false like him ay me i can no more die margaret for henry weeps that thou dost live so long noise within enter warwick salisbury and many commons it is reported mighty sovereign that good duke humphrey traitorously is murder'd by suffolk and the cardinal beaufort 's means the commons like an angry hive of bees that want their leader scatter up and down and care not who they sting in his revenge myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny until they hear the order of his death that he is dead good warwick tis too true but how he died god knows not henry enter his chamber view his breathless corpse and comment then upon his sudden death that shall i do my liege stay salisbury with the rude multitude till i return exit o thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts my thoughts that labour to persuade my soul some violent hands were laid on humphrey 's life if my suspect be false forgive me god for judgment only doth belong to thee fain would i go to chafe his paly lips with twenty thousand kisses and to drain upon his face an ocean of salt tears to tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk and with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling but all in vain are these mean obsequies and to survey his dead and earthly image what were it but to make my sorrow greater re enter warwick and others bearing gloucester 's body on a bed come hither gracious sovereign view this body that is to see how deep my grave is made for with his soul fled all my worldly solace for seeing him i see my life in death as surely as my soul intends to live with that dread king that took our state upon him to free us from his father 's wrathful curse i do believe that violent hands were laid upon the life of this thrice famed duke a dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue what instance gives lord warwick for his vow see how the blood is settled in his face oft have i seen a timely parted ghost of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless being all descended to the labouring heart who in the conflict that it holds with death attracts the same for aidance gainst the enemy which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth to blush and beautify the cheek again but see his face is black and full of blood his eye balls further out than when he lived staring full ghastly like a strangled man his hair uprear'd his nostrils stretched with struggling his hands abroad display'd as one that grasp'd and tugg'd for life and was by strength subdued look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking his well proportion'd beard made rough and rugged like to the summer 's corn by tempest lodged it can not be but he was murder'd here the least of all these signs were probable why warwick who should do the duke to death myself and beaufort had him in protection and we i hope sir are no murderers but both of you were vow'd duke humphrey 's foes and you forsooth had the good duke to keep tis like you would not feast him like a friend and tis well seen he found an enemy then you belike suspect these noblemen as guilty of duke humphrey 's timeless death who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh and sees fast by a butcher with an axe but will suspect twas he that made the slaughter who finds the partridge in the puttock 's nest but may imagine how the bird was dead although the kite soar with unbloodied beak even so suspicious is this tragedy are you the butcher suffolk where 's your knife is beaufort term'd a kite where are his talons i wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men but here 's a vengeful sword rusted with ease that shall be scoured in his rancorous heart that slanders me with murder 's crimson badge say if thou darest proud lord of warwick shire that i am faulty in duke humphrey 's death exeunt cardinal somerset and others what dares not warwick if false suffolk dare him he dares not calm his contumelious spirit nor cease to be an arrogant controller though suffolk dare him twenty thousand times madam be still with reverence may i say for every word you speak in his behalf is slander to your royal dignity blunt witted lord ignoble in demeanor if ever lady wrong'd her lord so much thy mother took into her blameful bed some stern untutor'd churl and noble stock was graft with crab tree slip whose fruit thou art and never of the nevils noble race but that the guilt of murder bucklers thee and i should rob the deathsman of his fee quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames and that my sovereign 's presence makes me mild i would false murderous coward on thy knee make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech and say it was thy mother that thou meant'st that thou thyself was born in bastardy and after all this fearful homage done give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell pernicious blood sucker of sleeping men thou shall be waking well i shed thy blood if from this presence thou darest go with me away even now or i will drag thee hence unworthy though thou art i 'll cope with thee and do some service to duke humphrey 's ghost exeunt suffolk and warwick what stronger breastplate than a heart untainted thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just and he but naked though lock'd up in steel whose conscience with injustice is corrupted a noise within what noise is this re enter suffolk and warwick with their weapons drawn why how now lords your wrathful weapons drawn here in our presence dare you be so bold why what tumultuous clamour have we here the traitorous warwick with the men of bury set all upon me mighty sovereign to the commons entering   sirs stand apart the king shall know your mind dread lord the commons send you word by me unless lord suffolk straight be done to death or banished fair england 's territories they will by violence tear him from your palace and torture him with grievous lingering death they say by him the good duke humphrey died they say in him they fear your highness death and mere instinct of love and loyalty free from a stubborn opposite intent as being thought to contradict your liking makes them thus forward in his banishment they say in care of your most royal person that if your highness should intend to sleep and charge that no man should disturb your rest in pain of your dislike or pain of death yet notwithstanding such a strait edict were there a serpent seen with forked tongue that slily glided towards your majesty it were but necessary you were waked lest being suffer'd in that harmful slumber the mortal worm might make the sleep eternal and therefore do they cry though you forbid that they will guard you whether you will or no from such fell serpents as false suffolk is with whose envenomed and fatal sting your loving uncle twenty times his worth they say is shamefully bereft of life within   an answer from the king my lord of salisbury tis like the commons rude unpolish'd hinds could send such message to their sovereign but you my lord were glad to be employ'd to show how quaint an orator you are but all the honour salisbury hath won is that he was the lord ambassador sent from a sort of tinkers to the king within   an answer from the king or we will all break in go salisbury and tell them all from me i thank them for their tender loving care and had i not been cited so by them yet did i purpose as they do entreat for sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy mischance unto my state by suffolk 's means and therefore by his majesty i swear whose far unworthy deputy i am he shall not breathe infection in this air but three days longer on the pain of death exit salisbury o henry let me plead for gentle suffolk ungentle queen to call him gentle suffolk no more i say if thou dost plead for him thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath had i but said i would have kept my word but when i swear it is irrevocable if after three days space thou here be'st found on any ground that i am ruler of the world shall not be ransom for thy life come warwick come good warwick go with me i have great matters to impart to thee exeunt all but queen margaret and suffolk mischance and sorrow go along with you heart 's discontent and sour affliction be playfellows to keep you company there 's two of you the devil make a third and threefold vengeance tend upon your steps cease gentle queen these execrations and let thy suffolk take his heavy leave fie coward woman and soft hearted wretch hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy a plague upon them wherefore should i curse them would curses kill as doth the mandrake 's groan i would invent as bitter searching terms as curst as harsh and horrible to hear deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth with full as many signs of deadly hate as lean faced envy in her loathsome cave my tongue should stumble in mine earnest words mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint mine hair be fixed on end as one distract ay every joint should seem to curse and ban and even now my burthen'd heart would break should i not curse them poison be their drink gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks their softest touch as smart as lizards sting their music frightful as the serpent 's hiss and boding screech owls make the concert full all the foul terrors in dark seated hell-- enough sweet suffolk thou torment'st thyself and these dread curses like the sun gainst glass or like an overcharged gun recoil and turn the force of them upon thyself you bade me ban and will you bid me leave now by the ground that i am banish'd from well could i curse away a winter 's night though standing naked on a mountain top where biting cold would never let grass grow and think it but a minute spent in sport o let me entreat thee cease give me thy hand that i may dew it with my mournful tears nor let the rain of heaven wet this place to wash away my woful monuments o could this kiss be printed in thy hand that thou mightst think upon these by the seal through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee so get thee gone that i may know my grief tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by as one that surfeits thinking on a want i will repeal thee or be well assured adventure to be banished myself and banished i am if but from thee go speak not to me even now be gone o go not yet even thus two friends condemn'd embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves loather a hundred times to part than die yet now farewell and farewell life with thee thus is poor suffolk ten times banished once by the king and three times thrice by thee tis not the land i care for wert thou thence a wilderness is populous enough so suffolk had thy heavenly company for where thou art there is the world itself with every several pleasure in the world and where thou art not desolation i can no more live thou to joy thy life myself no joy in nought but that thou livest enter vaux wither goes vaux so fast what news i prithee to signify unto his majesty that cardinal beaufort is at point of death for suddenly a grievous sickness took him that makes him gasp and stare and catch the air blaspheming god and cursing men on earth sometimes he talks as if duke humphrey 's ghost were by his side sometime he calls the king and whispers to his pillow as to him the secrets of his overcharged soul and i am sent to tell his majesty that even now he cries aloud for him go tell this heavy message to the king exit vaux ay me what is this world what news are these but wherefore grieve i at an hour 's poor loss omitting suffolk 's exile my soul 's treasure why only suffolk mourn i not for thee and with the southern clouds contend in tears theirs for the earth 's increase mine for my sorrows now get thee hence the king thou know'st is coming if thou be found by me thou art but dead if i depart from thee i can not live and in thy sight to die what were it else but like a pleasant slumber in thy lap here could i breathe my soul into the air as mild and gentle as the cradle babe dying with mother 's dug between its lips where from thy sight i should be raging mad and cry out for thee to close up mine eyes to have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth so shouldst thou either turn my flying soul or i should breathe it so into thy body and then it lived in sweet elysium to die by thee were but to die in jest from thee to die were torture more than death o let me stay befall what may befall away though parting be a fretful corrosive it is applied to a deathful wound to france sweet suffolk let me hear from thee for wheresoe'er thou art in this world 's globe i 'll have an iris that shall find thee out i go and take my heart with thee a jewel lock'd into the wofull'st cask that ever did contain a thing of worth even as a splitted bark so sunder we this way fall i to death this way for me exeunt severally scene iii a bedchamber enter the king salisbury warwick to the cardinal in bed how fares my lord speak beaufort to thy sovereign if thou be'st death i 'll give thee england 's treasure enough to purchase such another island so thou wilt let me live and feel no pain ah what a sign it is of evil

they will or no o torture me no more i will confess alive again then show me where he is i 'll give a thousand pound to look upon him he hath no eyes the dust hath blinded them comb down his hair look look it stands upright like lime twigs set to catch my winged soul give me some drink and bid the apothecary bring the strong poison that i bought of him o thou eternal mover of the heavens look with a gentle eye upon this wretch o beat away the busy meddling fiend that lays strong siege unto this wretch 's soul and from his bosom purge this black despair see how the pangs of death do make him grin disturb him not let him pass peaceably peace to his soul if god 's good pleasure be lord cardinal if thou think'st on heaven 's bliss hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope he dies and makes no

well the beginning that is dead and buried there comes an old man and his three sons,-- i could match this beginning with an old tale three proper young men of excellent growth and presence with bills on their necks be it known unto all men by these presents the eldest of the three wrestled with charles the duke 's wrestler which charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs that there is little hope of life in him so he served the second and so the third yonder they lie the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping alas but what is the sport monsieur that the ladies have lost why this that i speak of thus men may grow wiser every day it is the first time that ever i heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies or i i promise thee but is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides is there yet another dotes upon rib breaking shall we see this wrestling cousin you must if you stay here

your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise we pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt do young sir your reputation shall not therefore be misprised we will make it our suit to the duke that the wrestling might not go forward i beseech you punish me not with your hard thoughts wherein i confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies any thing but let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial wherein if i be foiled there is but one shamed that was never gracious if killed but one dead that was

o poor orlando thou art overthrown or charles or something weaker masters thee re enter le beau good sir i do in friendship counsel you to leave this place albeit you have deserved high commendation true applause and love yet such is now the duke 's condition that he misconstrues all that you have done the duke is humorous what he is indeed more suits you to conceive than i to speak of i thank you sir and pray you tell me this which of the two was daughter of the duke that here was at the wrestling neither his daughter if we judge by manners but yet indeed the lesser is his daughter the other is daughter to the banish'd duke and here detain'd by her usurping uncle to keep his daughter company whose loves are dearer than the natural bond of sisters but i can tell you that of late this duke hath ta'en displeasure gainst his gentle niece grounded upon no other argument but that the people praise her for her virtues and pity her for her good father 's sake and on my life his malice gainst the lady will suddenly break forth sir fare you well hereafter in a better world than this i shall desire more love and knowledge of you i rest much bounden to you fare you well exit le beau

if i could cry hem and have him come come wrestle with thy affections o they take the part of a better wrestler than myself o a good wish upon you you will try in time in despite of a fall but turning these jests out of service let us talk in good earnest is it possible on such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking with old sir rowland 's youngest son the duke my father loved his father dearly doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly by this kind of chase i should hate him for my father hated his father dearly yet i hate not orlando no faith hate him not for my sake why should i not doth he not deserve well let me love him for that and do you love him because i do look here comes the duke with his eyes full of anger enter duke frederick with lords mistress

beseech your grace let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me if with myself i hold intelligence or have acquaintance with mine own desires if that i do not dream or be not frantic,-- as i do trust i am not then dear uncle never so much as in a thought unborn did i offend your highness thus do all traitors if their purgation did consist in words they are as innocent as grace itself let it suffice thee that i trust thee not yet your mistrust can not make me a traitor tell me whereon the likelihood depends thou art thy father 's daughter there 's enough so was i when your highness took his dukedom so was i when your highness banish'd him treason is not inherited my lord or if we did derive it from our friends what 's that to me my father was no traitor then good my liege mistake me not so much to think my poverty is treacherous dear sovereign hear me speak ay celia we stay'd her for your sake else had she with her father ranged along i did not then entreat to have her stay it was your pleasure and your own remorse i was too young that time to value her but now i know her if she be a traitor why so am i we still have slept together rose at an instant learn'd play'd eat together and wheresoever we went like juno 's swans still we went coupled and inseparable she is too subtle for thee and her smoothness her very silence and her patience speak to the people and they pity her thou art a fool she robs thee of thy name and thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous when she is gone then open not thy lips firm and irrevocable is my doom which i have pass'd upon her she is banish'd pronounce that sentence then on me my liege i can not live out of her company you are a fool you niece provide yourself if you outstay the time upon mine honour and in the

smirch my face the like do you so shall we pass along and never stir assailants were it not better because that i am more than common tall that i did suit me all points like a man a gallant curtle axe upon my thigh a boar spear in my hand and in my heart lie there what hidden woman 's fear there will-- we 'll have a swashing and a martial outside as many other mannish cowards have that do outface it with their semblances what shall i call thee when thou art a man i 'll have no worse a name than jove 's own page and therefore look you call me ganymede but what will you be call'd something that hath a reference to my state no longer celia but aliena but cousin what if we assay'd to steal the clownish fool out of your father 's court would he not be a comfort to our travel he 'll go along

that feelingly persuade me what i am sweet are the uses of adversity which like the toad ugly and venomous wears yet a precious jewel in his head and this our life exempt from public haunt finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks sermons in stones and good in every thing i would not change it happy is your grace that can translate the stubbornness of fortune into so quiet and so sweet a style come shall we go and kill us venison and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools being native burghers of this desert city should in their own confines with forked heads have their round haunches gored indeed my lord the melancholy jaques grieves at that and in that kind swears you do more usurp than doth your brother that hath banish'd you to day my lord of amiens and myself did steal behind him as he lay along under an oak whose antique root peeps out upon the brook that brawls along this wood to the which place a poor sequester'd stag that from the hunter 's aim had ta'en a hurt did come to languish and indeed my lord the wretched animal heaved forth such groans that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat almost to bursting and the big round tears coursed one another down his innocent nose in piteous chase and thus the hairy fool much marked of the melancholy jaques stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook augmenting it with tears but what said jaques did he not moralize this spectacle o yes into a thousand similes first for his weeping into the needless stream poor deer quoth he thou makest a testament as worldlings do giving thy sum of more to that which had too much then being there alone left and abandon'd of his velvet friends tis right quoth he thus misery doth part the flux of company anon a careless herd full of the pasture jumps along by him and never stays to greet him ay quoth jaques sweep on you fat and greasy citizens tis just the fashion wherefore do you look upon that poor and broken bankrupt there thus most invectively he pierceth through the body of the country city court yea and of this our life swearing that we are mere usurpers tyrants and what 's worse to fright the animals and to kill them up in their assign'd and native dwelling place and did you leave him in this contemplation we did my lord weeping and commenting upon the sobbing deer show me the place i love to cope him in these sullen

lord he is but even now gone hence here was he merry hearing of a song if he compact of jars grow musical we shall have shortly discord in the spheres go seek him tell him i would speak with him enter jaques he saves my labour by his own approach why how now monsieur what a life is this that your poor friends must woo your company what you look merrily a fool a fool i met a fool i the forest a motley fool a miserable world as i do live by food i met a fool who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun and rail'd on lady fortune in good terms in good set terms and yet a motley fool good morrow fool quoth i. no sir quoth he call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune and then he drew a dial from his poke and looking on it with lack lustre eye says very wisely it is ten o'clock thus we may see quoth he how the world wags tis but an hour ago since it was nine and after one hour more twill be eleven and so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe and then from hour to hour we rot and rot and thereby hangs a tale when i did hear the motley fool thus moral on the time my lungs began to crow like chanticleer that fools should be so deep contemplative and i did laugh sans intermission an hour by his dial o noble fool a worthy fool motley 's the only wear what fool is this o worthy fool one that hath been a courtier and says if ladies be but young and fair they have the gift to know it and in his brain which is as dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage he hath strange places cramm'd with observation the which he vents in mangled forms o that i were a fool i am ambitious for a motley coat thou shalt have one it is my only suit provided that you weed your better judgments of all opinion that grows rank in them that i am wise i must have liberty withal as large a charter as the wind to blow on whom i please for so fools have and they that are most galled with my folly they most must laugh and why sir must they so the why is plain as way to parish church he that a fool doth very wisely hit doth very foolishly although he smart not to seem senseless of the bob if not the wise man 's folly is anatomized even by the squandering glances of the fool invest me in my motley give me leave to speak my mind and i will through and through cleanse the foul body of the infected world if they will patiently receive my medicine fie on thee i can tell what thou wouldst do what for a counter would i do but good most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin for thou thyself hast been a libertine as sensual as the brutish sting itself and all the embossed sores and headed evils that thou with licence of free foot hast caught wouldst thou disgorge into the general world why who cries out on pride that can therein tax any private party doth it not flow as hugely as the sea till that the weary very means do ebb what woman in the city do i name when that i say the city woman bears the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders who can come in and say that i mean her when such a one as she such is her neighbour or what is he of basest function that says his bravery is not of my cost thinking that i mean him but therein suits his folly to the mettle of my speech there then how then what then let me see wherein my tongue hath wrong'd him if it do him right then he hath wrong'd himself if he be free why then my taxing like a wild goose flies unclaim'd of any man but who comes here enter orlando with his sword drawn forbear and eat no more why i have eat none yet nor shalt not till necessity be served of what kind should this cock come of art thou thus bolden'd man by thy distress or else a rude despiser of good manners that in civility thou seem'st so empty you touch'd my vein at first the thorny point of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show of smooth civility yet am i inland bred and know some nurture but forbear i say he dies that touches any of this fruit till i and my affairs are answered an you will not be answered with reason i must die what would you have your gentleness shall force more than your force move us to gentleness i almost die for food and let me have it sit down and feed and welcome to our table speak you so gently pardon me i pray you i thought that all things had been savage here and therefore put i on the countenance of stern commandment but whate'er you are that in this desert inaccessible under the shade of melancholy boughs lose and neglect the creeping hours of time if ever you have look'd on better days if ever been where bells have knoll'd to church if ever sat at any good man 's feast if ever from your eyelids wiped a tear and know what tis to pity and be pitied let gentleness my strong enforcement be in the which hope i blush and hide my sword true is it that we have seen better days and have with holy bell been knoll'd to church and sat at good men 's feasts and wiped our eyes of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd and therefore sit you down in gentleness and take upon command what help we have that to your wanting may be minister'd then but forbear your food a little while whiles like a doe i go to find my fawn and give it food there is an old poor man who after me hath many a weary step limp'd in pure love till he be first sufficed oppress'd with two weak evils age and hunger i will not touch a bit go find him out and we will nothing waste till you return i thank ye and be blest for your good comfort exit thou seest we are not all alone unhappy this wide and universal theatre presents more woeful pageants than the scene wherein we play in all the world 's a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts his acts being seven ages at first the infant mewling and puking in the nurse 's arms and then the whining school boy with his satchel and shining morning face creeping like snail unwillingly to school and then the lover sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad made to his mistress eyebrow then a soldier full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel seeking the bubble reputation even in the cannon 's mouth and then the justice in fair round belly with good capon lined with eyes severe and beard of formal cut full of wise saws and modern instances and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon with spectacles on nose and pouch on side his youthful hose well saved a world too wide for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice turning again toward childish treble pipes and whistles in his sound last scene of all that ends this strange eventful history is second childishness and mere oblivion sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything re enter orlando with adam

very vile life now in respect it is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in respect it is not in the court it is tedious as is it a spare life look you it fits my humour well but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much against my stomach hast any philosophy in thee shepherd no more but that i know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is and that he that wants money means and content is without three good friends that the property of rain is to wet and fire to burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred such a one is a natural philosopher wast ever in court shepherd no truly then thou art damned nay i hope truly thou art damned like an ill roasted egg all on one side for not being at court your reason why if thou never wast at court thou never sawest good manners if thou never sawest good manners then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is sin and sin is damnation thou art in a parlous state shepherd not a whit touchstone those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court you told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands that courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds instance briefly come

see my ewes graze and my lambs suck that is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a bell wether and to betray a she lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked pated old cuckoldly ram out of all reasonable match if thou beest not damned for this the devil himself will have no shepherds i can not see else

earthquakes and so encounter nay but who is it is it possible nay i prithee now with most petitionary vehemence tell me who it is o wonderful wonderful and most wonderful wonderful and yet again wonderful and after that out of all hooping good my complexion dost thou think though i am caparisoned like a man i have a doublet and hose in my disposition one inch of delay more is a south sea of discovery i prithee tell me who is it quickly and speak apace i would thou couldst stammer that thou mightst pour this concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow- mouthed bottle either too much at once or none at all i prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that may drink thy tidings so you may put a man in your belly is he of god 's making what manner of man is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard nay he hath but a little beard why god will send more if the man will be thankful let me stay the growth of his beard if thou delay me not the knowledge of his

and when shalt thou see him again answer me in one word you must borrow me gargantua 's mouth first tis a word too great for any mouth of this age 's size to say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism but doth he know that i am in this forest and in man 's apparel looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled it is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover but take a taste of my finding him and relish it with good observance i found him under a tree like a dropped acorn it may well be called jove 's tree when it drops forth such fruit give me audience good madam proceed there lay he stretched along like a wounded knight though it be pity to see such a sight it well becomes the ground cry holla to thy tongue i prithee it

love songs in their barks i pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill favouredly rosalind is your love 's name yes just i do not like her name there was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened what stature is she of just as high as my heart you are full of pretty answers have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths wives and conned them out of rings not so but i answer you right painted cloth from whence you have studied your questions you have a nimble wit i think twas made of atalanta 's heels will you sit down with me and we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery i will chide no breather in the world but myself against whom i know most faults the worst fault you have is to be in love tis a fault i will not change for your best virtue i am weary of you by my troth i was seeking for a fool when i found you he is drowned in the brook look but in and you shall see him there i shall see mine own figure which i take to be either a fool or a cipher i 'll tarry no longer with you farewell good signior love i am glad of your departure adieu good monsieur melancholy exit jaques aside to celia   i will speak to him like a saucy lackey and under that habit play the knave with him do you hear forester very well what would you i pray you what is't o'clock you should ask me what time o day there 's no clock in the forest then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock and why not the swift foot of time had not that been as proper by no means sir time travels in divers paces with divers persons i 'll tell you who time ambles withal who time trots withal who time gallops withal and who he stands still withal i prithee who doth he trot withal marry he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized if the interim be but a se'nnight time 's pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year who ambles time withal with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he can not study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury these time ambles withal who doth he gallop withal with a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there who stays it still withal with lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves where dwell you pretty youth with this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat are you native of this place as the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling i have been told so of many but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love i have heard him read many lectures against it and i thank god i am not a woman to be touched with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women there were none principal they were all like one another as half pence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it i prithee recount some of them no i will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick there is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving rosalind on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of rosalind if i could meet that fancy monger i would give him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him i am he that is so love shaked i pray you tell me your remedy there is none of my uncle 's marks upon you he taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner what were his marks a lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have not but i pardon you for that for simply your having in beard is a younger brother 's revenue then your hose should be ungartered your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe untied and every thing about you demonstrating a careless desolation but you are no such man you are rather point device in your accoutrements as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other fair youth i would i could make thee believe i love me believe it you may as soon make her that you love believe it which i warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences but in good sooth are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind is so admired i swear to thee youth by the white hand of rosalind i am that he that unfortunate he but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak neither rhyme nor reason can express how much love is merely a madness and i tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too yet i profess curing it by counsel did you ever cure any so yes one and in this manner he was to imagine me his love his mistress and i set him every day to woo me at which time would i being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every passion something and for no passion truly any thing as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe him then entertain him then forswear him now weep for him then spit at him that i drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic and thus i cured him and this way will i take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep 's heart that there shall not be one spot of love in't i would not be cured youth i would cure you if you would but call me rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me now by the faith of my love i will tell me where it is go with me to it and i 'll show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live will you go with all my heart good youth nay you must call me rosalind come sister will you go exeunt scene iii the forest enter touchstone and audrey jaques behind come apace good audrey i will fetch up your goats audrey and how audrey am i the man yet doth my simple feature content you your features lord warrant us what features i am here with thee and thy goats as the most capricious poet honest ovid was among the goths

more dead than a great reckoning in a little room truly i would the gods had made thee poetical i do not know what poetical is is it honest in deed and word is it a true thing no truly for the truest poetry is the most feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical i do truly for thou swearest to me thou art honest now if thou wert a poet i might have some hope thou didst feign would you not have me honest no truly unless thou wert hard favoured for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar aside   a material fool well i am not fair and therefore i pray the gods make me honest truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish i am not a slut though i thank the gods i am foul well praised be the gods for thy foulness sluttishness may come hereafter but be it as it may be i will marry thee and to that end i have been with sir oliver martext the vicar of the next village who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us aside   i would fain see this meeting well the gods give us joy amen a man may if he were of a fearful heart stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple but the wood no assembly but horn beasts but what though c ourage as horns are odious they are necessary it is said many a man knows no end of his goods right many a man has good horns and knows no end of them well that is the dowry of his wife tis none of his own getting horns even so poor men alone no no the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal is the single man therefore blessed no as a walled town is more worthier than a village so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor and by how much defence is better than no skill by so much is a horn more precious than to want here comes sir oliver enter sir oliver martext sir oliver martext you are well met will you dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go with you to your chapel is there none here to give the woman i will not take her on gift of any man truly she must be given or the marriage

toy in hand here sir nay pray be covered will you be married motley as the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and as pigeons bill so wedlock would

together as they join wainscot then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp aside   i am not in the mind but i were better to be married of him than of another for he is

holy bread he hath bought a pair of cast lips of diana a nun of winter 's sisterhood kisses not more religiously the very ice of chastity is in them but why did he swear he would come this morning and comes not nay certainly there is no truth in him do you think so yes i think he is not a pick purse nor a horse stealer but for his verity in love i do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a worm eaten nut not true in love yes when he is in but i think he is not in you have heard him swear downright he was was is not is besides the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster they are both the confirmer of false reckonings he attends here in the forest on the duke your father i met the duke yesterday and had much question with him he asked me of what parentage i was i told him of as good as he so he laughed and let me go but what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as orlando o that 's a brave man he writes brave verses speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of his lover as a puisny tilter that spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble goose but all 's brave that youth mounts and folly guides who comes here enter corin mistress and master you have oft inquired after the shepherd that complain'd of love who you saw sitting by me on the turf praising the proud disdainful

not be thy executioner i fly thee for i would not injure thee thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye tis pretty sure and very probable that eyes that are the frail'st and softest things who shut their coward gates on atomies should be call'd tyrants butchers murderers now i do frown on thee with all my heart and if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down or if thou canst not o for shame for shame lie not to say mine eyes are murderers now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee scratch thee but with a pin and there remains some scar of it lean but upon a rush the cicatrice and capable impressure thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes which i have darted at thee hurt thee not nor i am sure there is no force in eyes that can do hurt o dear phebe if ever,--as that ever may be near,-- you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy then shall you know the wounds invisible that love 's keen arrows make but till that time come not thou near me and when that time comes afflict me with thy mocks pity me not as till that time i shall not pity thee and why i pray you who might be your mother that you insult exult and all at once over the wretched what though you have no beauty,-- as by my faith i see no more in you than without candle may go dark to bed-- must you be therefore proud and pitiless why what means this why do you look on me i see no more in you than in the ordinary of nature 's sale work od 's my little life i think she means to tangle my eyes too no faith proud mistress hope not after it tis not your inky brows your black silk hair your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream that can entame my spirits to your worship you foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her like foggy south puffing with wind and rain you are a thousand times a properer man than she a woman tis such fools as you that makes the world full of ill favour'd children tis not her glass but you that flatters her and out of you she sees herself more proper than any of her lineaments can show her but mistress know yourself down on your knees and thank heaven fasting for a good man 's love for i must tell you friendly in your ear sell when you can you are not for all markets cry the man mercy love him take his offer foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer so take her to thee shepherd fare you well sweet youth i pray you chide a year together i had rather hear you chide than this man woo he 's fallen in love with your foulness and she 'll fall in love with my anger if it be so as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks i 'll sauce her with bitter words why look you so upon me for no ill will i bear you i pray you do not fall in love with me for i am falser than vows made in wine besides i like you not

none could be so abused in sight as he come to our flock exeunt rosalind celia and corin dead shepherd now i find thy saw of might who ever loved that loved not at first sight sweet phebe,-- ha what say'st thou silvius sweet phebe pity me why i am sorry for thee gentle silvius wherever sorrow is relief would be if you do sorrow at my grief in love by giving love your sorrow and my grief were both extermined thou hast my love is not that neighbourly i would have you why that were covetousness silvius the time was that i hated thee and yet it is not that i bear thee love but since that thou canst talk of love so well thy company which erst was irksome to me i will endure and i 'll employ thee too but do not look for further recompense than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd so holy and so perfect is my love and i in such a poverty of grace that i shall think it a most plenteous crop to glean the broken ears after the man that the main harvest reaps loose now and then a scatter'd smile and that i 'll live upon know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile not very well but i have met him oft and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds that the old carlot once was master of think not i love him though i ask for him tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well but what care i for words yet words do well when he that speaks them pleases those that hear it is a pretty youth not very pretty but sure he 's proud and yet his pride becomes him he 'll make a proper man the best thing in him is his complexion and faster than his tongue did make offence his eye did heal it up he is not very tall yet for his years he 's tall his leg is but so so and yet tis well there was a pretty redness in his lip a little riper and more lusty red than that mix'd in his cheek twas just the difference between the constant red and mingled damask there be some women silvius had they mark'd him in parcels as i did would have gone near to fall in love with him but for my part i love him not nor hate him not and yet i have more cause to hate him than to love him for what had he to do to chide at me he said mine eyes were black and my hair black and now i am remember'd scorn'd at me i marvel why i answer'd not again but that 's all one omittance is no quittance i 'll write to him a very taunting letter and thou shalt bear it wilt thou silvius phebe with all my heart i 'll write it straight the matter 's in my head and in my heart i will be bitter with him and passing short go with me silvius exeunt act iv scene i. the forest enter rosalind celia and jaques i prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted with thee they say you are a melancholy fellow i am so i do love it better than laughing those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards why tis good to be sad and say nothing why then tis good to be a post i have neither the scholar 's melancholy which is emulation nor the musician 's which is fantastical nor the courtier 's which is proud nor the soldier 's which is ambitious nor the lawyer 's which is politic nor the lady 's which is nice nor the lover 's which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry 's contemplation of my travels in which my often rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness a traveller by my faith you have great reason to be sad i fear you have sold your own lands to see other men 's then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands yes i have gained my experience and your experience makes you sad i had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to travel for it too enter orlando good day and happiness dear rosalind nay then god be wi you an you talk in blank verse exit farewell monsieur traveller look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be out of love with your nativity and almost chide god for making you that countenance you are or i will scarce think you have swam in a gondola why how now orlando where have you been all this while you a lover an you serve me such another trick never come in my sight more my fair rosalind i come within an hour of my promise break an hour 's promise in love he that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said of him that cupid hath clapped him o the shoulder but i 'll warrant him heart whole pardon me dear rosalind nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight i had as lief be wooed of a snail of a snail ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries his house on his head a better jointure i think than you make a woman besides he brings his destiny with him what 's that why horns which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife virtue is no horn maker and my rosalind is virtuous and i am your rosalind it pleases him to call you so but he hath a rosalind of a better leer than you come woo me woo me for now i am in a holiday humour and like enough to consent what would you say to me now an i were your very very rosalind i would kiss before i spoke nay you were better speak first and when you were gravelled for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lacking god warn us!--matter the cleanliest shift is to kiss how if the kiss be denied then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter who could be out being before his beloved mistress marry that should you if i were your mistress or i should think my honesty ranker than my wit what of my suit not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit am not i your rosalind i take some joy to say you are because i would be talking of her well in her person i say i will not have you then in mine own person i die no faith die by attorney the poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicit in a love cause troilus had his brains dashed out with a grecian club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love leander he would have lived many a fair year though hero had turned nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish coroners of that age found it was hero of sestos but these are all lies men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love i would not have my right rosalind of this mind for i protest her frown might kill me by this hand it will not kill a fly but come now i will be your rosalind in a more coming on disposition and ask me what you will i will grant it then love me rosalind yes faith will i fridays and saturdays and all and wilt thou have me ay and twenty such what sayest thou are you not good i hope so why then can one desire too much of a good thing come sister you shall be the priest and marry us give me your hand orlando what do you say sister pray thee marry us i can not say the words you must begin will you orlando-- go to will you orlando have to wife this rosalind i will ay but when why now as fast as she can marry us then you must say i take thee rosalind for wife i take thee rosalind for wife i might ask you for your commission but i do take thee orlando for my husband there 's a girl goes before the priest and certainly a woman 's thought runs before her actions so do all thoughts they are winged now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her for ever and a day say a day without the ever no no orlando men are april when they woo december when they we d maids are may when they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives i will be more jealous of thee than a barbary cock pigeon over his hen more clamorous than a parrot against rain more new fangled than an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey i will weep for nothing like diana in the fountain and i will do that when you are disposed to be merry i will laugh like a hyen and that when thou art inclined to sleep but will my rosalind do so by my life she will do as i do o but she is wise or else she could not have the wit to do this the wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a woman 's wit and it will out at the casement shut that and twill out at the key hole stop that twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney a man that had a wife with such a wit he might say wit whither wilt nay you might keep that cheque for it till you met your wife 's wit going to your neighbour 's bed and what wit could wit have to excuse that marry to say she came to seek you there you shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue o that woman that can not make her fault her husband 's occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool for these two hours rosalind i will leave thee alas dear love i can not lack thee two hours i must attend the duke at dinner by two o'clock i will be with thee again ay go your ways go your ways i knew what you would prove my friends told me as much and i thought no less that flattering tongue of yours won me tis but one cast away and so come death two o'clock is your hour ay sweet rosalind by my troth and in good earnest and so god mend me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour i will think you the most pathetical break promise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep your promise with no less religion than if thou wert indeed my rosalind so

affection hath an unknown bottom like the bay of portugal or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour affection in it runs out no that same wicked bastard of venus that was begot of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness that blind rascally boy that abuses every one 's eyes because his own are out let him be judge how deep i am in love i 'll tell thee aliena i can not be out of

she was writing of it it bears an angry tenor pardon me i am but as a guiltless messenger patience herself would startle at this letter and play the swaggerer bear this bear all she says i am not fair that i lack manners she calls me proud and that she could not love me were man as rare as phoenix od 's my will her love is not the hare that i do hunt why writes she so to me well shepherd well this is a letter of your own device no i protest i know not the contents phebe did write it come come you are a fool and turn'd into the extremity of love i saw her hand she has a leathern hand a freestone colour'd hand i verily did think that her old gloves were on but twas her hands she has a huswife 's hand but that 's no matter i say she never did invent this letter this is a man 's invention and his hand sure it is hers why tis a boisterous and a cruel style a style for challengers why she defies me like turk to christian women 's gentle brain could not drop forth such giant rude invention such ethiope words blacker in their effect than in their countenance will you hear the letter so please you for i never heard it yet yet heard too much of phebe 's cruelty she phebes me mark how the tyrant writes reads art thou god to shepherd turn'd that a maiden 's heart hath burn'd can a woman rail thus call you this railing reads why thy godhead laid apart warr'st thou with a woman 's heart did you ever hear such railing whiles the eye of man did woo me that could do no vengeance to me meaning me a beast if the scorn of your bright eyne have power to raise such love in mine alack in me what strange effect would they work in mild aspect whiles you chid me i did love how then might your prayers move he that brings this love to thee little knows this love in me and by him seal up thy mind whether that thy youth and kind will the faithful offer take of me and all that i can make or else by him my love deny and then i 'll study how to die call you this chiding alas poor shepherd do you pity him no he deserves no pity wilt thou love such a woman what to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee not to be endured well go your way to her for i see love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to her that if she love me i charge her to love thee if she will not i will never have her unless thou entreat for her if you be a true lover hence and not a word for here

profit by a tongue then should i know you by description such garments and such years the boy is fair of female favour and bestows himself like a ripe sister the woman low and browner than her brother

are you he i am what must we understand by this some of my shame if you will know of me what man i am and how and why and where this handkercher was stain'd i pray you tell it when last the young orlando parted from you he left a promise to return again within an hour and pacing through the forest chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy lo what befell he threw his eye aside and mark what object did present itself under an oak whose boughs were moss'd with age and high top bald with dry antiquity a wretched ragged man o'ergrown with hair lay sleeping on his back about his neck a green and gilded snake had wreathed itself who with her head nimble in threats approach'd the opening of his mouth but suddenly seeing orlando it unlink'd itself and with indented glides did slip away into a bush under which bush 's shade a lioness with udders all drawn dry lay couching head on ground with catlike watch when that the sleeping man should stir for tis the royal disposition of that beast to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead this seen orlando did approach the man and found it was his brother his elder brother o i have heard him speak of that same brother and he did render him the most unnatural that lived amongst men and well he might so do for well i know he was unnatural but to orlando did he leave him there food to the suck'd and hungry lioness twice did he turn his back and purposed so but kindness nobler ever than revenge and nature stronger than his just occasion made him give battle to the lioness who quickly fell before him in which hurtling from miserable slumber i awaked are you his brother wast you he rescued was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him twas i but tis not i \t i do not shame to tell you what i was since my conversion so sweetly tastes being the thing i am but for the bloody napkin by and by when from the first to last betwixt us two tears our recountments had most kindly bathed as how i came into that desert place:-- in brief he led me to the gentle duke who gave me fresh array and entertainment committing me unto my brother 's love who led me instantly unto his cave there stripp'd himself and here upon his arm the lioness had torn some flesh away which all this while had bled and now he fainted and cried in fainting upon rosalind brief i recover'd him bound up his wound and after some small space being strong at heart he sent me hither stranger as i am to tell this story that you might excuse his broken promise and to give this napkin dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth that he in sport doth call his rosalind rosalind swoons why how now ganymede sweet ganymede many will swoon when they do look on blood there is more in it cousin ganymede look he recovers i would i were at home we 'll lead you

swoon when he showed me your handkerchief ay and greater wonders than that o i know where you are nay tis true there was never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and caesar 's thrasonical brag of i came saw and overcame for your brother and my sister no sooner met but they looked no sooner looked but they loved no sooner loved but they sighed no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent or else be incontinent before marriage they are in the very wrath of love and they will together clubs can not part them they shall be married to morrow and i will bid the duke to the nuptial but o how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man 's eyes by so much the more shall i to morrow be at the height of heart heaviness by how much i shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for why then to morrow i can not serve your turn for rosalind i can live no longer by thinking i will weary you then no longer with idle talking know of me then for now i speak to some purpose that i know you are a gentleman of good conceit i speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge insomuch i say i know you are neither do i labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you to do yourself good and not to grace me believe then if you please that i can do strange things i have since i was three year old conversed with a magician most profound in his art and yet not damnable if you do love rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out when your brother marries aliena shall you marry her i know into what straits of fortune she is driven and it is not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient to you to set her before your eyes tomorrow human as she is and without any danger speakest thou in sober meanings by my life i do which i tender dearly though i say i am a magician therefore put you in your best array bid your friends for if you will be married to morrow you shall and to rosalind if you will enter silvius and phebe look here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers youth you have done me much ungentleness to show the letter that i writ to you i care not if i have it is my study to seem despiteful and ungentle to you

himself this is called the quip modest if again it was not well cut he disabled my judgment this is called the reply churlish if again it was not well cut he would answer i spake not true this is called the reproof valiant if again it was not well cut he would say i lied this is called the counter cheque quarrelsome and so to the lie circumstantial and the lie direct and how oft did you say

speed antonius to touch calpurnia for our elders say the barren touched in this holy chase shake off their sterile curse i shall remember when caesar says do this it is perform'd set on and leave no ceremony out flourish caesar ha who calls bid every noise be still peace yet again who is it in the press that calls on me i hear a tongue shriller than all the music cry caesar speak caesar is turn'd to hear beware the ides of march what man is that a soothsayer bids you beware the ides of march set him before me let me see his face fellow come from the throng look upon caesar what say'st thou to me now speak once again beware the ides of march he is a dreamer let us leave him pass sennet exeunt all except brutus and cassius will you go see the order of the course not i. i pray you do i am not gamesome i do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in antony let me not hinder cassius your desires i 'll leave you brutus i do observe you now of late i have not from your eyes that gentleness and show of love as i was wo nt to have you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand over your friend that loves you cassius be not deceived if i have veil'd my look i turn the trouble of my countenance merely upon myself vexed i am of late with passions of some difference conceptions only proper to myself which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors but let not therefore my good friends be grieved-- among which number cassius be you one-- nor construe any further my neglect than that poor brutus with himself at war forgets the shows of love to other men then brutus i have much mistook your passion by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried thoughts of great value worthy cogitations tell me good brutus can you see your face no cassius for the eye sees not itself but by reflection by some other things tis just and it is very much lamented brutus that you have no such mirrors as will turn your hidden worthiness into your eye that you might see your shadow i have heard where many of the best respect in rome except immortal caesar speaking of brutus and groaning underneath this age 's yoke have wish'd that noble brutus had his eyes into what dangers would you lead me cassius that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me therefore good brutus be prepared to hear and since you know you can not see yourself so well as by reflection i your glass will modestly discover to yourself that of yourself which you yet know not of and be not jealous on me gentle brutus were i a common laugher or did use to stale with ordinary oaths my love to every new protester if you know that i do fawn on men and hug them hard and after scandal them or if you know that i profess myself in banqueting to all the rout then hold me dangerous flourish and shout what means this shouting i do fear the people choose caesar for their king ay do you fear it then must i think you would not have it so i would not cassius yet i love him well but wherefore do you hold me here so long what is it that you would impart to me if it be aught toward the general good set honour in one eye and death i the other and i will look on both indifferently for let the gods so speed me as i love the name of honour more than i fear death i know that virtue to be in you brutus as well as i do know your outward favour well honour is the subject of my story i can not tell what you and other men think of this life but for my single self i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself i was born free as caesar so were you we both have fed as well and we can both endure the winter 's cold as well as he for once upon a raw and gusty day the troubled tiber chafing with her shores caesar said to me darest thou cassius now leap in with me into this angry flood and swim to yonder point upon the word accoutred as i was i plunged in and bade him follow so indeed he did the torrent roar'd and we did buffet it with lusty sinews throwing it aside and stemming it with hearts of controversy but ere we could arrive the point proposed caesar cried help me cassius or i sink i as aeneas our great ancestor did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder the old anchises bear so from the waves of tiber did i the tired caesar and this man is now become a god and cassius is a wretched creature and must bend his body if caesar carelessly but nod on him he had a fever when he was in spain and when the fit was on him i did mark how he did shake tis true this god did shake his coward lips did from their colour fly and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his lustre i did hear him groan ay and that tongue of his that bade the romans mark him and write his speeches in their books alas it cried give me some drink titinius as a sick girl ye gods it doth amaze me a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the majestic world and bear the palm alone shout flourish another general shout i do believe that these applauses are for some new honours that are heap'd on caesar why man he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves dishonourable graves men at some time are masters of their fates the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings brutus and caesar what should be in that caesar why should that name be sounded more than yours write them together yours is as fair a name sound them it doth become the mouth as well weigh them it is as heavy conjure with 'em brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar now in the names of all the gods at once upon what meat doth this our caesar feed that he is grown so great age thou art shamed rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods when went there by an age since the great flood but it was famed with more than with one man when could they say till now that talk'd of rome that her wide walls encompass'd but one man now is it rome indeed and room enough when there is in it but one only man o you and i have heard our fathers say there was a brutus once that would have brook'd the eternal devil to keep his state in rome as easily as a king that you do love me i am nothing jealous what you would work me to i have some aim how i have thought of this and of these times i shall recount hereafter for this present i would not so with love i might entreat you be any further moved what you have said i will consider what you have to say i will with patience hear and find a time both meet to hear and answer such high things till then my noble friend chew upon this brutus had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of rome under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us i am glad that my weak words have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus the games are done and caesar is returning as they pass by pluck casca by the sleeve and he will after his sour fashion tell you what hath proceeded worthy note to day re enter caesar and his train i will do so but look you cassius the angry spot doth glow on caesar 's brow and all the rest look like a chidden train calpurnia 's cheek is pale and cicero looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the capitol being cross'd in conference by some senators casca will tell us what the matter is antonius caesar let me have men about me that are fat sleek headed men and such as sleep o nights yond cassius has a lean and hungry look he thinks too much such men are dangerous fear him not caesar he 's not dangerous he is a noble roman and well given would he were fatter but i fear him not yet if my name were liable to fear i do not know the man i should avoid so soon as that spare cassius he reads much he is a great observer and he looks quite through the deeds of men he loves no plays as thou dost antony he hears no music seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort as if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit that could be moved to smile at any thing such men as he be never at heart 's ease whiles they behold a greater than themselves and therefore are they very dangerous i rather tell thee what is to be fear'd than what i fear for always i am caesar come on my right hand for this ear is deaf and tell me truly what thou think'st of him sennet exeunt caesar and all his train but casca you pull'd me by the cloak would you speak with me ay casca tell us what hath chanced to day that caesar looks so sad why you were with him were you not i should not then ask casca what had chanced why there was a crown offered him and being offered him he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the people fell a shouting what was the second noise for why for that too they shouted thrice what was the last cry for why for that too was the crown offered him thrice ay marry was't and he put it by thrice every time gentler than other and at every putting by mine honest neighbours shouted who offered him the crown why antony tell us the manner of it gentle casca i can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it it was mere foolery i did not mark it i saw mark antony offer him a crown;--yet twas not a crown neither twas one of these coronets;--and as i told you he put it by once but for all that to my thinking he would fain have had it then he offered it to him again then he put it by again but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his fingers off it and then he offered it the third time he put it the third time by and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night caps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked caesar for he swounded and fell down at it and for mine own part i durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air but soft i pray you what did caesar swound he fell down in the market place and foamed at mouth and was speechless tis very like he hath the failing sickness no caesar hath it not but you and i and honest casca we have the falling sickness i know not what you mean by that but i am sure caesar fell down if the tag rag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do the players in the theatre i am no true man what said he when he came unto himself marry before he fell down when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut an i had been a man of any occupation if i would not have taken him at a word i would i might go to hell among the rogues and so he fell when he came to himself again he said if he had done or said any thing amiss he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity three or four wenches where i stood cried alas good soul and forgave him with all their hearts but there 's no heed to be taken of them if caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less and after that he came thus sad away ay did cicero say any thing ay he spoke greek to what effect nay an i tell you that ill ne'er look you i the face again but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads but for mine own part it was greek to me i could tell you more news too marullus and flavius for pulling scarfs off caesar 's images are put to silence fare you well there was more foolery yet if i could remember it will you sup with me to night casca no i am promised forth will you dine with me to morrow ay if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating good i will expect you do so farewell both exit what a blunt fellow is this grown to be he was quick mettle when he went to school so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise however he puts on this tardy form this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite and so it is for this time i will leave you to morrow if you please to speak with me i will come home to you or if you will come home to me and i will wait for you i will do so till then think of the world exit brutus well brutus thou art noble yet i see thy honourable metal may be wrought from that it is disposed therefore it is meet that noble minds keep ever with their likes for who so firm that can not be seduced caesar doth bear me hard but he loves brutus if i were brutus now and he were cassius he should not humour me i will this night in several hands in at his windows throw as if they came from several citizens writings all tending to the great opinion that rome holds of his name wherein obscurely caesar 's ambition shall be glanced at and after this let caesar seat him sure for we will shake him or worse days endure exit scene iii the same a street thunder and lightning enter from opposite sides casca with his sword drawn and cicero good even casca brought you caesar home why are you breathless and why stare you so are not you moved when all the sway of earth shakes like a thing unfirm o cicero i have seen tempests when the scolding winds have rived the knotty oaks and i have seen the ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam to be exalted with the threatening clouds but never till to night never till now did i go through a tempest dropping fire either there is a civil strife in heaven or else the world too saucy with the gods incenses them to send destruction why saw you any thing more wonderful a common slave you know him well by sight-- held up his left hand which did flame and burn like twenty torches join'd and yet his hand not sensible of fire remain'd unscorch'd besides i ha not since put up my sword-- against the capitol i met a lion who glared upon me and went surly by without annoying me and there were drawn upon a heap a hundred ghastly women transformed with their fear who swore they saw men all in fire walk up and down the streets and yesterday the bird of night did sit even at noon day upon the market place hooting and shrieking when these prodigies do so conjointly meet let not men say these are their reasons they are natural for i believe they are portentous things unto the climate that they point upon indeed it is a strange disposed time but men may construe things after their fashion clean from the purpose of the things themselves come caesar to the capitol to morrow he doth for he did bid antonius send word to you he would be there to morrow good night then casca this disturbed sky is not to walk in farewell cicero exit cicero enter cassius who 's there a roman casca by your voice your ear is good cassius what night is this a very pleasing night to honest men who ever knew the heavens menace so those that have known the earth so full of faults for my part i have walk'd about the streets submitting me unto the perilous night and thus unbraced casca as you see have bared my bosom to the thunder stone and when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open the breast of heaven i did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens it is the part of men to fear and tremble when the most mighty gods by tokens send such dreadful heralds to astonish us you are dull casca and those sparks of life that should be in a roman you do want or else you use not you look pale and gaze and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder to see the strange impatience of the heavens but if you would consider the true cause why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts why birds and beasts from quality and kind why old men fool and children calculate why all these things change from their ordinance their natures and preformed faculties to monstrous quality,--why you shall find that heaven hath infused them with these spirits to make them instruments of fear and warning unto some monstrous state now could i casca name to thee a man most like this dreadful night that thunders lightens opens graves and roars as doth the lion in the capitol a man no mightier than thyself or me in personal action yet prodigious grown and fearful as these strange eruptions are tis caesar that you mean is it not cassius let it be who it is for romans now have thews and limbs like to their ancestors but woe the while our fathers minds are dead and we are govern'd with our mothers spirits our yoke and sufferance show us womanish indeed they say the senators tomorrow mean to establish caesar as a king and he shall wear his crown by sea and land in every place save here in italy i know where i will wear this dagger then cassius from bondage will deliver cassius therein ye gods you make the weak most strong therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron can be retentive to the strength of spirit but life being weary of these worldly bars never lacks power to dismiss itself if i know this know all the world besides that part of tyranny that i do bear i can shake off at pleasure thunder still so can i so every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity and why should caesar be a tyrant then poor man i know he would not be a wolf but that he sees the romans are but sheep he were no lion were not romans hinds those that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straws what trash is rome what rubbish and what offal when it serves for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as caesar but o grief where hast thou led me i perhaps speak this before a willing bondman then i know my answer must be made but i am arm'd and dangers are to me indifferent you speak to casca and to such a man that is no fleering tell tale hold my hand be factious for redress of all these griefs and i will set this foot of mine as far as who goes farthest there 's a bargain made now know you casca i have moved already some certain of the noblest minded romans to undergo with me an enterprise of honourable dangerous consequence and i do know by this they stay for me in pompey 's porch for now this fearful night there is no stir or walking in the streets and the complexion of the element in favour 's like the work we have in hand most bloody fiery and most terrible stand close awhile for here comes one in haste tis cinna i do know him by his gait he is a friend enter cinna cinna where haste you so to find out you who 's that metellus cimber no it is casca one incorporate to our attempts am i not stay'd for cinna i am glad on t. what a fearful night is this there 's two or three of us have seen strange sights am i not stay'd for tell me yes you are o cassius if you could but win the noble brutus to our party-- be you content good cinna take this paper and look you lay it in the praetor 's chair where brutus may but find it and throw this in at his window set this up with wax upon old brutus statue all this done repair to pompey 's porch where you shall find us is decius brutus and trebonius there all but metellus cimber and he 's gone to seek you at your house well i will hie and so bestow these papers as you bade me that done repair to pompey 's theatre exit cinna come casca you and i will yet ere day see brutus at his house three parts of him is ours already and the man entire upon the next encounter yields him ours o he sits high in all the people 's hearts and that which would appear offence in us his countenance like richest alchemy will change to virtue and to worthiness him and his worth and our great need of him you have right well conceited let us go for it is after midnight and ere day we will awake him and be sure of him exeunt act ii scene i. rome brutus 's orchard enter brutus what lucius ho i can not by the progress of the stars give guess how near to day lucius i say i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly when lucius when awake i say what lucius enter lucius call'd you my lord get me a taper in my study lucius when it is lighted come and call me here i will my lord exit it must be by his death and for my part i know no personal cause to spurn at him but for the general he would be crown'd how that might change his nature there 's the question it is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craves wary walking crown him?--that;-- and then i grant we put a sting in him that at his will he may do danger with the abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar i have not known when his affections sway'd more than his reason but tis a common proof that lowliness is young ambition 's ladder whereto the climber upward turns his face but when he once attains the upmost round he then unto the ladder turns his back looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend so caesar may then lest he may prevent and since the quarrel will bear no colour for the thing he is fashion it thus that what he is augmented would run to these and these extremities and therefore think him as a serpent 's egg which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous and kill him in the shell re enter lucius the taper burneth in your closet sir searching the window for a flint i found this paper thus seal'd up and i am sure it did not lie there when i went to bed gives him the letter get you to bed again it is not day is not to morrow boy the ides of march i know not sir look in the calendar and bring me word i will sir exit the exhalations whizzing in the air give so much light that i may read by them opens the letter and reads brutus thou sleep'st awake and see thyself shall rome   and c. speak strike redress brutus thou sleep'st awake such instigations have been often dropp'd where i have took them up shall rome   and c. thus must i piece it out shall rome stand under one man 's awe what rome my ancestors did from the streets of rome the tarquin drive when he was call'd a king speak strike redress am i entreated to speak and strike o rome i make thee promise if the redress will follow thou receivest thy full petition at the hand of brutus re enter lucius sir march is wasted fourteen days knocking within tis good go to the gate somebody knocks exit lucius since cassius first did whet me against caesar i have not slept between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream the genius and the mortal instruments are then in council and the state of man like to a little kingdom suffers then the nature of an insurrection re enter lucius sir tis your brother cassius at the door who doth desire to see you is he alone no sir there are moe with him do you know them no sir their hats are pluck'd about their ears and half their faces buried in their cloaks that by no means i may discover them by any mark of favour let 'em enter exit lucius they are the faction o conspiracy shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night when evils are most free o then by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage seek none conspiracy hide it in smiles and affability for if thou path thy native semblance on not erebus itself were dim enough to hide thee from prevention enter the conspirators cassius casca decius brutus cinna metellus cimber and trebonius i think we are too bold upon your rest good morrow brutus do we trouble you i have been up this hour awake all night know i these men that come along with you yes every man of them and no man here but honours you and every one doth wish you had but that opinion of yourself which every noble roman bears of you this is trebonius he is welcome hither this decius brutus he is welcome too this casca this cinna and this metellus cimber they are all welcome what watchful cares do interpose themselves betwixt your eyes and night shall i entreat a word brutus and cassius whisper here lies the east doth not the day break here no o pardon sir it doth and yon gray lines that fret the clouds are messengers of day you shall confess that you are both deceived here as i point my sword the sun arises which is a great way growing on the south weighing the youthful season of the year some two months hence up higher toward the north he first presents his fire and the high east stands as the capitol directly here give me your hands all over one by one and let us swear our resolution no not an oath if not the face of men the sufferance of our souls the time 's abuse,-- if these be motives weak break off betimes and every man hence to his idle bed so let high sighted tyranny range on till each man drop by lottery but if these as i am sure they do bear fire enough to kindle cowards and to steel with valour the melting spirits of women then countrymen what need we any spur but our own cause to prick us to redress what other bond than secret romans that have spoke the word and will not palter and what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged that this shall be or we will fall for it swear priests and cowards and men cautelous old feeble carrions and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits to think that or our cause or our performance did need an oath when every drop of blood that every roman bears and nobly bears is guilty of a several bastardy if he do break the smallest particle of any promise that hath pass'd from him but what of cicero shall we sound him i think he will stand very strong with us let us not leave him out no by no means o let us have him for his silver hairs will purchase us a good opinion and buy men 's voices to commend our deeds it shall be said his judgment ruled our hands our youths and wildness shall no whit appear but all be buried in his gravity o name him not let us not break with him for he will never follow any thing that other men begin then leave him out indeed he is not fit shall no man else be touch'd but only caesar decius well urged i think it is not meet mark antony so well beloved of caesar should outlive caesar we shall find of him a shrewd contriver and you know his means if he improve them may well stretch so far as to annoy us all which to prevent let antony and caesar fall together our course will seem too bloody caius cassius to cut the head off and then hack the limbs like wrath in death and envy afterwards for antony is but a limb of caesar let us be sacrificers but not butchers caius we all stand up against the spirit of caesar and in the spirit of men there is no blood o that we then could come by caesar 's spirit and not dismember caesar but alas caesar must bleed for it and gentle friends let 's kill him boldly but not wrathfully let 's carve him as a dish fit for the gods not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds and let our hearts as subtle masters do stir up their servants to an act of rage and after seem to chide 'em this shall make our purpose necessary and not envious which so appearing to the common eyes we shall be call'd purgers not murderers and for mark antony think not of him for he can do no more than caesar 's arm when caesar 's head is off yet i fear him for in the ingrafted love he bears to caesar-- alas good cassius do not think of him if he love caesar all that he can do is to himself take thought and die for caesar and that were much he should for he is given to sports to wildness and much company there is no fear in him let him not die for he will live and laugh at this hereafter clock strikes peace count the clock the clock hath stricken three tis time to part but it is doubtful yet whether caesar will come forth to day or no for he is superstitious grown of late quite from the main opinion he held once of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies it may be these apparent prodigies the unaccustom'd terror of this night and the persuasion of his augurers may hold him from the capitol to day never fear that if he be so resolved i can o'ersway him for he loves to hear that unicorns may be betray'd with trees and bears with glasses elephants with holes lions with toils and men with flatterers but when i tell him he hates flatterers he says he does being then most flattered let me work for i can give his humour the true bent and i will bring him to the capitol nay we will all of us be there to fetch him by the eighth hour is that the uttermost be that the uttermost and fail not then caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard who rated him for speaking well of pompey i wonder none of you have thought of him now good metellus go along by him he loves me well and i have given him reasons send him but hither and i 'll fashion him the morning comes upon 's we 'll leave you brutus and friends disperse yourselves but all remember what you have said and show yourselves true romans good gentlemen look fresh and merrily let not our looks put on our purposes but bear it as our roman actors do with untired spirits and formal constancy and so good morrow to you every one exeunt all but brutus boy lucius fast asleep it is no matter enjoy the honey heavy dew of slumber thou hast no figures nor no fantasies which busy care draws in the brains of men therefore thou sleep'st so sound enter portia brutus my lord portia what mean you wherefore rise you now it is not for your health thus to commit your weak condition to the raw cold morning nor for yours neither you 've ungently brutus stole from my bed and yesternight at supper you suddenly arose and walk'd about musing and sighing with your arms across and when i ask'd you what the matter was you stared upon me with ungentle looks i urged you further then you scratch'd your head and too impatiently stamp'd with your foot yet i insisted yet you answer'd not but with an angry wafture of your hand gave sign for me to leave you so i did fearing to strengthen that impatience which seem'd too much enkindled and withal hoping it was but an effect of humour which sometime hath his hour with every man it will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep and could it work so much upon your shape as it hath much prevail'd on your condition i should not know you brutus dear my lord make me acquainted with your cause of grief i am not well in health and that is all brutus is wise and were he not in health he would embrace the means to come by it why so i do good portia go to bed is brutus sick and is it physical to walk unbraced and suck up the humours of the dank morning what is brutus sick and will he steal out of his wholesome bed to dare the vile contagion of the night and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air to add unto his sickness no my brutus you have some sick offence within your mind which by the right and virtue of my place i ought to know of and upon my knees i charm you by my once commended beauty by all your vows of love and that great vow which did incorporate and make us one that you unfold to me yourself your half why you are heavy and what men to night have had to resort to you for here have been some six or seven who did hide their faces even from darkness kneel not gentle portia i should not need if you were gentle brutus within the bond of marriage tell me brutus is it excepted i should know no secrets that appertain to you am i yourself but as it were in sort or limitation to keep with you at meals comfort your bed and talk to you sometimes dwell i but in the suburbs of your good pleasure if it be no more portia is brutus harlot not his wife you are my true and honourable wife as dear to me as are the ruddy drops that visit my sad heart if this were true then should i know this secret i grant i am a woman but withal a woman that lord brutus took to wife i grant i am a woman but withal a woman well reputed cato 's daughter think you i am no stronger than my sex being so father'd and so husbanded tell me your counsels i will not disclose 'em i have made strong proof of my constancy giving myself a voluntary wound here in the thigh can i bear that with patience and not my husband 's secrets o ye gods render me worthy of this noble wife knocking within hark hark one knocks portia go in awhile and by and by thy bosom shall partake the secrets of my heart all my engagements i will construe to thee all the charactery of my sad brows leave me with haste exit portia lucius who 's that knocks re enter lucius with ligarius he is a sick man that would speak with you caius ligarius that metellus spake of boy stand aside caius ligarius how vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue o what a time have you chose out brave caius to wear a kerchief would you were not sick i am not sick if brutus have in hand any exploit worthy the name of honour such an exploit have i in hand ligarius had you a healthful ear to hear of it by all the gods that romans bow before i here discard my sickness soul of rome brave son derived from honourable loins thou like an exorcist hast conjured up my mortified spirit now bid me run and i will strive with things impossible yea get the better of them what 's to do a piece of work that will make sick men whole but are not some whole that we must make sick that must we also what it is my caius i shall unfold to thee as we are going to whom it must be done set on your foot and with a heart new fired i follow you to do i know not what but it sufficeth that brutus leads me on follow me then exeunt scene ii caesar 's house thunder and lightning enter caesar in his night gown nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to night

lord exit enter calpurnia what mean you caesar think you to walk forth you shall not stir out of your house to day caesar shall forth the things that threaten'd me ne'er look'd but on my back when they shall see the face of caesar they are vanished caesar i never stood on ceremonies yet now they fright me there is one within besides the things that we have heard and seen recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch a lioness hath whelped in the streets and graves have yawn'd and yielded up their dead fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds in ranks and squadrons and right form of war which drizzled blood upon the capitol the noise of battle hurtled in the air horses did neigh and dying men did groan and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets o caesar these things are beyond all use and i do fear them what can be avoided whose end is purposed by the mighty gods yet caesar shall go forth for these predictions are to the world in general as to caesar when beggars die there are no comets seen the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes cowards die many times before their deaths the valiant never taste of death but once of all the wonders that i yet have heard it seems to me most strange that men should fear seeing that death a necessary end will come when it will come re enter servant what say the augurers they would not have you to stir forth to day plucking the entrails of an offering forth they could not find a heart within the beast the gods do this in shame of cowardice caesar should be a beast without a heart if he should stay at home to day for fear no caesar shall not danger knows full well that caesar is more dangerous than he we are two lions litter'd in one day and i the elder and more terrible and caesar shall go forth alas my lord your wisdom is consumed in confidence do not go forth to day call it my fear that keeps you in the house and not your own we 'll send mark antony to the senate house and he shall say you are not well to day let me upon my knee prevail in this mark antony shall say i am not well and for thy humour i will stay at home enter decius brutus here 's decius brutus he shall tell them so caesar all hail good morrow worthy caesar i come to fetch you to the senate house and you are come in very happy time to bear my greeting to the senators and tell them that i will not come to day can not is false and that i dare not falser i will not come to day tell them so decius say he is sick shall caesar send a lie have i in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far to be afraid to tell graybeards the truth decius go tell them caesar will not come most mighty caesar let me know some cause lest i be laugh'd at when i tell them so the cause is in my will i will not come that is enough to satisfy the senate but for your private satisfaction because i love you i will let you know calpurnia here my wife stays me at home she dreamt to night she saw my statua which like a fountain with an hundred spouts did run pure blood and many lusty romans came smiling and did bathe their hands in it and these does she apply for warnings and portents and evils imminent and on her knee hath begg'd that i will stay at home to day this dream is all amiss interpreted it was a vision fair and fortunate your statue spouting blood in many pipes in which so many smiling romans bathed signifies that from you great rome shall suck reviving blood and that great men shall press for tinctures stains relics and cognizance this by calpurnia 's dream is signified and this way have you well expounded it i have when you have heard what i can say and know it now the senate have concluded to give this day a crown to mighty caesar if you shall send them word you will not come their minds may change besides it were a mock apt to be render'd for some one to say break up the senate till another time when caesar 's wife shall meet with better dreams if caesar hide himself shall they not whisper lo caesar is afraid pardon me caesar for my dear dear love to our proceeding bids me tell you this and reason to my love is liable how foolish do your fears seem now calpurnia i am ashamed i did yield to them give me my robe for i will

brutus he draws mark antony out of the way exeunt antony and trebonius where is metellus cimber let him go and presently prefer his suit to caesar he is address'd press near and second him casca you are the first that rears your hand are we all ready what is now amiss that caesar and his senate must redress most high most mighty and most puissant caesar metellus cimber throws before thy seat an humble heart,-- kneeling i must prevent thee cimber these couchings and these lowly courtesies might fire the blood of ordinary men and turn pre ordinance and first decree into the law of children be not fond to think that caesar bears such rebel blood that will be thaw'd from the true quality with that which melteth fools i mean sweet words low crooked court'sies and base spaniel fawning thy brother by decree is banished if thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him i spurn thee like a cur out of my way know caesar doth not wrong nor without cause will he be satisfied is there no voice more worthy than my own to sound more sweetly in great caesar 's ear for the repealing of my banish'd brother i kiss thy hand but not in flattery caesar desiring thee that publius cimber may have an immediate freedom of repeal what brutus pardon caesar caesar pardon as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber i could be well moved if i were as you if i could pray to move prayers would move me but i am constant as the northern star of whose true fix'd and resting quality there is no fellow in the firmament the skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks they are all fire and every one doth shine but there 's but one in all doth hold his place so in the world tis furnish'd well with men and men are flesh and blood and apprehensive yet in the number i do know but one that unassailable holds on his rank unshaked of motion and that i am he let me a little show it even in this that i was constant cimber should be banish'd and constant do remain to keep him so o caesar,-- hence wilt thou lift up olympus great caesar,-- doth not brutus bootless kneel speak hands for me casca first then the other conspirators and brutus stab caesar et tu brute then fall caesar dies liberty freedom tyranny is dead run hence proclaim cry it about the streets some to the common pulpits and cry out liberty freedom and enfranchisement people and senators be not affrighted fly not stand stiff ambition 's debt is paid go to the pulpit brutus and cassius too where 's publius here quite confounded with this mutiny stand fast together lest some friend of caesar 's should chance-- talk not of standing publius good cheer there is no harm intended to your person nor to no roman else so tell them publius and leave us publius lest that the people rushing on us should do your age some mischief do so and let no man abide this deed but we the doers re enter trebonius where is antony fled to his house amazed men wives and children stare cry out and run as it were doomsday fates we will know your pleasures that we shall die we know tis but the time and drawing days out that men stand upon why he that cuts off twenty years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death grant that and then is death a benefit so are we caesar 's friends that have abridged his time of fearing death stoop romans stoop and let us bathe our hands in caesar 's blood up to the elbows and besmear our swords then walk we forth even to the market place and waving our red weapons o'er our heads let 's all cry peace freedom and liberty stoop then and wash how many ages hence shall this our lofty scene be acted over in states unborn and accents yet unknown how many times shall caesar bleed in sport that now on pompey 's basis lies along no worthier than the dust so oft as that shall be so often shall the knot of us be call'd the men that gave their country liberty what shall we forth ay every man away brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels with the most boldest and best hearts of rome enter a servant soft who comes here a friend of antony 's thus brutus did my master bid me kneel thus did mark antony bid me fall down and being prostrate thus he bade me say brutus is noble wise valiant and honest caesar was mighty bold royal and loving say i love brutus and i honour him say i fear'd caesar honour'd him and loved him if brutus will vouchsafe that antony may safely come to him and be resolved how caesar hath deserved to lie in death mark antony shall not love caesar dead so well as brutus living but will follow the fortunes and affairs of noble brutus thorough the hazards of this untrod state with all true faith so says my master antony thy master is a wise and valiant roman i never thought him worse tell him so please him come unto this place he shall be satisfied and by my honour depart untouch'd i 'll fetch him presently exit i know that we shall have him well to friend i wish we may but yet have i a mind that fears him much and my misgiving still falls shrewdly to the purpose but here comes antony re enter antony welcome mark antony o mighty caesar dost thou lie so low are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils shrunk to this little measure fare thee well i know not gentlemen what you intend who else must be let blood who else is rank if i myself there is no hour so fit as caesar 's death hour nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords made rich with the most noble blood of all this world i do beseech ye if you bear me hard now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke fulfil your pleasure live a thousand years i shall not find myself so apt to die no place will please me so no mean of death as here by caesar and by you cut off the choice and master spirits of this age o antony beg not your death of us though now we must appear bloody and cruel as by our hands and this our present act you see we do yet see you but our hands and this the bleeding business they have done our hearts you see not they are pitiful and pity to the general wrong of rome-- as fire drives out fire so pity pity-- hath done this deed on caesar for your part to you our swords have leaden points mark antony our arms in strength of malice and our hearts of brothers temper do receive you in with all kind love good thoughts and reverence your voice shall be as strong as any man 's in the disposing of new dignities only be patient till we have appeased the multitude beside themselves with fear and then we will deliver you the cause why i that did love caesar when i struck him have thus proceeded i doubt not of your wisdom let each man render me his bloody hand first marcus brutus will i shake with you next caius cassius do i take your hand now decius brutus yours now yours metellus yours cinna and my valiant casca yours though last not last in love yours good trebonius gentlemen all,--alas what shall i say my credit now stands on such slippery ground that one of two bad ways you must conceit me either a coward or a flatterer that i did love thee caesar o tis true if then thy spirit look upon us now shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death to see thy thy anthony making his peace shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes most noble in the presence of thy corse had i as many eyes as thou hast wounds weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood it would become me better than to close in terms of friendship with thine enemies pardon me julius here wast thou bay'd brave hart here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand sign'd in thy spoil and crimson'd in thy lethe o world thou wast the forest to this hart and this indeed o world the heart of thee how like a deer strucken by many princes dost thou here lie mark antony,-- pardon me caius cassius the enemies of caesar shall say this then in a friend it is cold modesty i blame you not for praising caesar so but what compact mean you to have with us will you be prick'd in number of our friends or shall we on and not depend on you therefore i took your hands but was indeed sway'd from the point by looking down on caesar friends am i with you all and love you all upon this hope that you shall give me reasons why and wherein caesar was dangerous or else were this a savage spectacle our reasons are so full of good regard that were you antony the son of caesar you should be satisfied that 's all i seek and am moreover suitor that i may produce his body to the market place and in the pulpit as becomes a friend speak in the order of his funeral you shall mark antony brutus a word with you aside to brutus you know not what you do do not consent that antony speak in his funeral know you how much the people may be moved by that which he will utter by your pardon i will myself into the pulpit first and show the reason of our caesar 's death what antony shall speak i will protest he speaks by leave and by permission and that we are contented caesar shall have all true rites and lawful ceremonies it shall advantage more than do us wrong i know not what may fall i like it not mark antony here take you caesar 's body you shall not in your funeral speech blame us but speak all good you can devise of caesar and say you do't by our permission else shall you not have any hand at all about his funeral and you shall speak in the same pulpit whereto i am going after my speech is ended be it so i do desire no more prepare the body then and follow us exeunt all but antony o pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth that i am meek and gentle with these butchers thou art the ruins of the noblest man that ever lived in the tide of times woe to the hand that shed this costly blood over thy wounds now do i prophesy,-- which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue-- a curse shall light upon the limbs of men domestic fury and fierce civil strife shall cumber all the parts of italy blood and destruction shall be so in use and dreadful objects so familiar that mothers shall but smile when they behold their infants quarter'd with the hands of war all pity choked with custom of fell deeds and caesar 's spirit ranging for revenge with ate by his side come hot from hell shall in these confines with a monarch 's voice cry   havoc and let slip the dogs of war that this foul deed shall smell above the earth with carrion men groaning for burial enter a servant you serve octavius caesar do you not i do mark antony caesar did write for him to come to rome he did receive his letters and is coming and bid me say to you by word of mouth-- o caesar!-- seeing the body thy heart is big get thee apart and weep passion i see is catching for mine eyes seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine began to water is thy master coming he lies to night within seven leagues of rome post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced here is a mourning rome a dangerous rome no rome of safety for octavius yet hie hence and tell him so yet stay awhile thou shalt not back till i have borne this corse into the market place there shall i try in my oration how the people take the cruel issue of these bloody men according to the which thou shalt discourse to young octavius of the state of things lend me your hand exeunt with caesar 's body scene ii the forum enter brutus and cassius and a throng of citizens we will be satisfied let us be satisfied then follow me and give me audience friends cassius go you into the other street and part the numbers those that will hear me speak let 'em stay here those that will follow cassius go with him and public reasons shall be rendered of caesar 's death i will hear brutus speak i will hear cassius and compare their reasons when severally we hear them rendered exit cassius with some of the citizens brutus goes into the pulpit the noble brutus is ascended silence be patient till the last romans countrymen and lovers hear me for my cause and be silent that you may hear believe me for mine honour and have respect to mine honour that you may believe censure me in your wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge if there be any in this assembly any dear friend of caesar 's to him i say that brutus love to caesar was no less than his if then that friend demand why brutus rose against caesar this is my answer --not that i loved caesar less but that i loved rome more had you rather caesar were living and die all slaves than that caesar were dead to live all free men as caesar loved me i weep for him as he was fortunate i rejoice at it as he was valiant i honour him but as he was ambitious i slew him there is tears for his love joy for his fortune honour for his valour and death for his ambition who is here so base that would be a bondman if any speak for him have i offended who is here so rude that would not be a roman if any speak for him have i offended who is here so vile that will not love his country if any speak for him have i offended i pause for a reply none brutus none then none have i offended i have done no more to caesar than you shall do to brutus the question of his death is enrolled in the capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offences enforced for which he suffered death enter antony and others with caesar 's body here comes his body mourned by mark antony who though he had no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not with this i depart,--that as i slew my best lover for the good of rome i have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death live brutus live live bring him with triumph home unto his house give him a statue with his ancestors let him be caesar caesar 's better parts shall be crown'd in brutus we 'll bring him to his house with shouts and clamours my countrymen,-- peace silence brutus speaks peace ho good countrymen let me depart alone and for my sake stay here with antony do grace to caesar 's corpse and grace his speech tending to caesar 's glories which mark antony by our permission is allow'd to make i do entreat you not a man depart save i alone till antony have spoke exit stay ho and let us hear mark antony let him go up into the public chair we 'll hear him noble antony go up for brutus sake i am beholding to you goes into the pulpit what does he say of brutus he says for brutus sake he finds himself beholding to us all twere best he speak no harm of brutus here this caesar was a tyrant nay that 's certain we are blest that rome is rid of him peace let us hear what antony can say you gentle romans,-- peace ho let us hear him friends romans countrymen lend me your ears i come to bury caesar not to praise him the evil that men do lives after them the good is oft interred with their bones so let it be with caesar the noble brutus hath told you caesar was ambitious if it were so it was a grievous fault and grievously hath caesar answer'd it here under leave of brutus and the rest-- for brutus is an honourable man so are they all all honourable men-- come i to speak in caesar 's funeral he was my friend faithful and just to me but brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honourable man he hath brought many captives home to rome whose ransoms did the general coffers fill did this in caesar seem ambitious when that the poor have cried caesar hath wept ambition should be made of sterner stuff yet brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honourable man you all did see that on the lupercal i thrice presented him a kingly crown which he did thrice refuse was this ambition yet brutus says he was ambitious and sure he is an honourable man i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke but here i am to speak what i do know you all did love him once not without cause what cause withholds you then to mourn for him o judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason bear with me my heart is in the coffin there with caesar and i must pause till it come back to me methinks there is much reason in his sayings if thou consider rightly of the matter caesar has had great wrong has he masters i fear there will a worse come in his place mark'd ye his words he would not take the crown therefore tis certain he was not ambitious if it be found so some will dear abide it poor soul his eyes are red as fire with weeping there 's not a nobler man in rome than antony now mark him he begins again to speak but yesterday the word of caesar might have stood against the world now lies he there and none so poor to do him reverence o masters if i were disposed to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong who you all know are honourable men i will not do them wrong i rather choose to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you than i will wrong such honourable men but here 's a parchment with the seal of caesar i found it in his closet tis his will let but the commons hear this testament-- which pardon me i do not mean to read-- and they would go and kiss dead caesar 's wounds and dip their napkins in his sacred blood yea beg a hair of him for memory and dying mention it within their wills bequeathing it as a rich legacy unto their issue we 'll hear the will read it mark antony the will the will we will hear caesar 's will have patience gentle friends i must not read it it is not meet you know how caesar loved you you are not wood you are not stones but men and being men bearing the will of caesar it will inflame you it will make you mad tis good you know not that you are his heirs for if you should o what would come of it read the will we 'll hear it antony you shall read us the will caesar 's will will you be patient will you stay awhile i have o'ershot myself to tell you of it i fear i wrong the honourable men whose daggers have stabb'd caesar i do fear it they were traitors honourable men the will the testament they were villains murderers the will read the will you will compel me then to read the will then make a ring about the corpse of caesar and let me show you him that made the will shall i descend and will you give me leave come down descend you shall have leave antony comes down a ring stand round stand from the hearse stand from the body room for antony most noble antony nay press not so upon me stand far off stand back room bear back if you have tears prepare to shed them now you all do know this mantle i remember the first time ever caesar put it on twas on a summer 's evening in his tent that day he overcame the nervii look in this place ran cassius dagger through see what a rent the envious casca made through this the well beloved brutus stabb'd and as he pluck'd his cursed steel away mark how the blood of caesar follow'd it as rushing out of doors to be resolved if brutus so unkindly knock'd or no for brutus as you know was caesar 's angel judge o you gods how dearly caesar loved him this was the most unkindest cut of all for when the noble caesar saw him stab ingratitude more strong than traitors arms quite vanquish'd him then burst his mighty heart and in his mantle muffling up his face even at the base of pompey 's statua which all the while ran blood great caesar fell o what a fall was there my countrymen then i and you and all of us fell down whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us o now you weep and i perceive you feel the dint of pity these are gracious drops kind souls what weep you when you but behold our caesar 's vesture wounded look you here here is himself marr'd

done this deed are honourable what private griefs they have alas i know not that made them do it they are wise and honourable and will no doubt with reasons answer you i come not friends to steal away your hearts i am no orator as brutus is but as you know me all a plain blunt man that love my friend and that they know full well that gave me public leave to speak of him for i have neither wit nor

mouths and bid them speak for me but were i brutus and brutus antony there were an antony would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue in every wound of caesar that should move the stones of rome to

go you to caesar 's house fetch the will hither and we shall determine how to cut off some charge in legacies what shall i find you here or here or at the capitol exit lepidus this is a slight unmeritable man meet to be sent on errands is it fit the three fold world divided he should stand one of the three to share it so you thought him and took his voice who should be prick'd to die in our black sentence and proscription octavius i have seen more days than you and though we lay these honours on this man to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold to groan and sweat under the business either led or driven as we point the way and having brought our treasure where we will then take we down his load and turn him off like to the empty ass to shake his ears and graze in commons you may do your will but he 's a tried and valiant soldier so is my horse octavius and for that i do appoint him store of provender it is a creature that i teach to fight to wind to stop to run directly on his corporal motion govern'd by my spirit and in some taste is lepidus but so he must be taught and train'd and bid go forth a barren spirited fellow one that feeds on abjects orts and imitations which out of use and staled by other men begin his fashion do not talk of him but as a property and now octavius listen great things:--brutus and cassius are levying powers we must straight make head therefore let our alliance be combined our best friends made our means stretch'd and let us presently go sit in council how covert matters may be best disclosed and open perils surest answered let us do so for we are at the stake and bay'd about with many enemies and some that smile have in their hearts i fear millions of mischiefs exeunt scene ii camp near sardis before brutus 's tent drum enter brutus lucilius lucius and soldiers titinius and pindarus meeting them stand ho give the word ho and stand what now lucilius is cassius near he is at hand and pindarus is come to do you salutation from his master he greets me well your master pindarus in his own change or by ill officers hath given me some worthy cause to wish things done undone but if he be at hand i shall be satisfied i do not doubt but that my noble master will appear such as he is full of regard and honour he is not doubted a word lucilius how he received you let me be resolved with courtesy and with respect enough but not with such familiar instances nor with such free and friendly conference as he hath used of old thou hast described a hot friend cooling ever note lucilius when love begins to sicken and decay it useth an enforced ceremony there are no tricks in plain and simple faith but hollow men like horses hot at hand make gallant show and promise of their mettle but when they should endure the bloody spur they fall their crests and like deceitful jades sink in the trial comes his army on they mean this night in sardis to be quarter'd the greater part the horse in general are come with cassius hark he is arrived low march within march gently on to meet him enter cassius and his powers stand ho stand ho speak the word along stand stand stand most noble brother you have done me wrong judge me you gods wrong i mine enemies and if not so how should i wrong a brother brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs and when you do them-- cassius be content speak your griefs softly i do know you well before the eyes of both our armies here which should perceive nothing but love from us let us not wrangle bid them move away then in my tent cassius enlarge your griefs and i will give you audience pindarus bid our commanders lead their charges off a little from this ground lucilius do you the like and let no man come to our tent till we have done our conference let lucius and titinius guard our door exeunt scene iii brutus 's tent enter brutus and cassius that you have wrong'd me doth appear in this you have condemn'd and noted lucius pella for taking bribes here of the sardians wherein my letters praying on his side because i knew the man were slighted off you wronged yourself to write in such a case in such a time as this it is not meet that every nice offence should bear his comment let me tell you cassius you yourself are much condemn'd to have an itching palm to sell and mart your offices for gold to undeservers i an itching palm you know that you are brutus that speak this or by the gods this speech were else your last the name of cassius honours this corruption and chastisement doth therefore hide his head chastisement remember march the ides of march remember did not great julius bleed for justice sake what villain touch'd his body that did stab and not for justice what shall one of us that struck the foremost man of all this world but for supporting robbers shall we now contaminate our fingers with base bribes and sell the mighty space of our large honours for so much trash as may be grasped thus i had rather be a dog and bay the moon than such a roman brutus bay not me i 'll not endure it you forget yourself to hedge me in i am a soldier i older in practise abler than yourself to make conditions go to you are not cassius i am i say you are not urge me no more i shall forget myself have mind upon your health tempt me no further away slight man is't possible hear me for i will speak must i give way and room to your rash choler shall i be frighted when a madman stares o ye gods ye gods must i endure all this all this ay more fret till your proud heart break go show your slaves how choleric you are and make your bondmen tremble must i budge must i observe you must i stand and crouch under your testy humour by the gods you shall digest the venom of your spleen though it do split you for from this day forth i 'll use you for my mirth yea for my laughter when you are waspish is it come to this you say you are a better soldier let it appear so make your vaunting true and it shall please me well for mine own part i shall be glad to learn of noble men you wrong me every way you wrong me brutus i said an elder soldier not a better did i say better if you did i care not when caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me peace peace you durst not so have tempted him i durst not no what durst not tempt him for your life you durst not do not presume too much upon my love i may do that i shall be sorry for you have done that you should be sorry for there is no terror cassius in your threats for i am arm'd so strong in honesty that they pass by me as the idle wind which i respect not i did send to you for certain sums of gold which you denied me for i can raise no money by vile means by heaven i had rather coin my heart and drop my blood for drachmas than to wring from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash by any indirection i did send to you for gold to pay my legions which you denied me was that done like cassius should i have answer'd caius cassius so when marcus brutus grows so covetous to lock such rascal counters from his friends be ready gods with all your thunderbolts dash him to pieces i denied you not you did i did not he was but a fool that brought my answer back brutus hath rived my heart a friend should bear his friend 's infirmities but brutus makes mine greater than they are i do not till you practise them on me you love me not i do not like your faults a friendly eye could never see such faults a flatterer 's would not though they do appear as huge as high olympus come antony and young octavius come revenge yourselves alone on cassius for cassius is aweary of the world hated by one he loves braved by his brother cheque'd like a bondman all his faults observed set in a note book learn'd and conn'd by rote to cast into my teeth o i could weep my spirit from mine eyes there is my dagger and here my naked breast within a heart dearer than plutus mine richer than gold if that thou be'st a roman take it forth i that denied thee gold will give my heart strike as thou didst at caesar for i know when thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better than ever thou lovedst cassius sheathe your dagger be angry when you will it shall have scope do what you will dishonour shall be humour o cassius you are yoked with a lamb that carries anger as the flint bears fire who much enforced shows a hasty spark and straight is cold again hath cassius lived to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus when grief and blood ill temper'd vexeth him when i spoke that i was ill temper'd too do you confess so much give me your hand and my heart too o brutus what 's the matter have not you love enough to bear with me when that rash humour which my mother gave me makes me forgetful yes cassius and from henceforth when you are over earnest with your brutus he 'll think your mother chides and leave you so within   let me go in to see the generals there is some grudge between 'em tis not meet they be alone within   you shall not come to them within   nothing but death shall stay me enter poet followed by lucilius titinius and lucius how now what 's the matter for shame you generals what do you mean love and be friends as two such men should be for i have seen more years i 'm sure than ye ha ha how vilely doth this cynic rhyme get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence bear with him brutus tis his fashion i 'll know his humour when he knows his time what should the wars do with these jigging fools companion hence away away be gone exit poet lucilius and titinius bid the commanders prepare to lodge their companies to night and come yourselves and bring messala with you immediately to us exeunt lucilius and titinius lucius a bowl of wine exit lucius i did not think you could have been so angry o cassius i am sick of many griefs of your philosophy you make no use if you give place to accidental evils no man bears sorrow better portia is dead ha portia she is dead how scaped i killing when i cross'd you so o insupportable and touching loss upon what sickness impatient of my absence and grief that young octavius with mark antony have made themselves so strong:--for with her death that tidings came;--with this she fell distract and her attendants absent swallow'd fire and died so even so o ye immortal gods re enter lucius with wine and taper speak no more of her give me a bowl of wine in this i bury all unkindness cassius my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge fill lucius till the wine o'erswell the cup i can not drink too much of brutus love come in titinius exit lucius re enter titinius with messala welcome good messala now sit we close about this taper here and call in question our necessities portia art thou gone no more i pray you messala i have here received letters that young octavius and mark antony come down upon us with a mighty power bending their expedition toward philippi myself have letters of the selfsame tenor with what addition that by proscription and bills of outlawry octavius antony and lepidus have put to death an hundred senators therein our letters do not well agree mine speak of seventy senators that died by their proscriptions cicero being one cicero one cicero is dead and by that order of proscription had you your letters from your wife my lord no messala nor nothing in your letters writ of her nothing messala that methinks is strange why ask you hear you aught of her in yours no my lord now as you are a roman tell me true then like a roman bear the truth i tell for certain she is dead and by strange manner why farewell portia we must die messala with meditating that she must die once i have the patience to endure it now even so great men great losses should endure i have as much of this in art as you but yet my nature could not bear it so well to our work alive what do you think of marching to philippi presently i do not think it good your reason this it is tis better that the enemy seek us so shall he waste his means weary his soldiers doing himself offence whilst we lying still are full of rest defense and nimbleness good reasons must of force give place to better the people twixt philippi and this ground do stand but in a forced affection for they have grudged us contribution the enemy marching along by them by them shall make a fuller number up come on refresh'd new added and encouraged from which advantage shall we cut him off if at philippi we do face him there these people at our back hear me good brother under your pardon you must note beside that we have tried the utmost of our friends our legions are brim full our cause is ripe the enemy increaseth every day we at the height are ready to decline there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune omitted all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries on such a full sea are we now afloat and we must take the current when it serves or lose our ventures then with your will go on we 'll along ourselves and meet them at philippi the deep of night is crept upon our talk and nature must obey necessity which we will niggard with a little rest there is no more to say no more good night early to morrow will we rise and hence lucius enter lucius my gown exit lucius farewell good messala good night titinius noble noble cassius good night and good repose o my dear brother this was an ill beginning of

to my brother cassius bid him set on his powers betimes before and we will follow it shall be done my lord exeunt act v scene i. the plains of philippi enter octavius antony and their army now antony our hopes are answered you said the enemy would not come down but keep the hills and upper regions it proves not so their battles are at hand they mean to warn us at philippi here answering before we do demand of them tut i am in their bosoms and i know wherefore they do it they could be content to visit other places and come down with fearful bravery thinking by this face to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage but tis not so enter a messenger prepare you generals the enemy comes on in gallant show their bloody sign of battle is hung out and something to be done immediately octavius lead your battle softly on upon the left hand of the even field upon the right hand i keep thou the left why do you cross me in this exigent i do not cross you but i will do so march drum enter brutus cassius and their army lucilius titinius messala and others they stand and would have parley stand fast titinius we must out and talk mark antony shall we give sign of battle no caesar we will answer on their charge make forth the generals would have some words stir not until the signal words before blows is it so countrymen not that we love words better as you do good words are better than bad strokes octavius in your bad strokes brutus you give good words witness the hole you made in caesar 's heart crying long live hail caesar antony the posture of your blows are yet unknown but for your words they rob the hybla bees and leave them honeyless not stingless too o yes and soundless too for you have stol'n their buzzing antony and very wisely threat before you sting villains you did not so when your vile daggers hack'd one another in the sides of caesar you show'd your teeth like apes and fawn'd like hounds and bow'd like bondmen kissing caesar 's feet whilst damned casca like a cur behind struck caesar on the neck o you flatterers flatterers now brutus thank yourself this tongue had not offended so to day if cassius might have ruled come come the cause if arguing make us sweat the proof of it will turn to redder drops look i draw a sword against conspirators when think you that the sword goes up again never till caesar 's three and thirty wounds be well avenged or till another caesar have added slaughter to the sword of traitors caesar thou canst not die by traitors hands unless thou bring'st them with thee so i hope i was not born to die on brutus sword o if thou wert the noblest of thy strain young man thou couldst not die more honourable a peevish schoolboy worthless of such honour join'd with a masker and a reveller old cassius still come antony away defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth if you dare fight to day come to the field if not when you have stomachs exeunt octavius antony and their army why now blow wind swell billow and swim bark the storm is up and all is on the hazard ho lucilius hark a word with you standing forth \t my lord brutus and lucilius converse apart messala standing forth   what says my general messala this is my birth day as this very day was cassius born give me thy hand messala be thou my witness that against my will as pompey was am i compell'd to set upon one battle all our liberties you know that i held epicurus strong and his opinion now i change my mind and partly credit things that do presage coming from sardis on our former ensign two mighty eagles fell and there they perch'd gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands who to philippi here consorted us this morning are they fled away and gone and in their steads do ravens crows and kites fly o'er our heads and downward look on us as we were sickly prey their shadows seem a canopy most fatal under which our army lies ready to give up the ghost believe not so i but believe it partly for i am fresh of spirit and resolved to meet all perils very constantly even so lucilius now most noble brutus the gods to day stand friendly that we may lovers in peace lead on our days to age but since the affairs of men rest still incertain let 's reason with the worst that may befall if we do lose this battle then is this the very last time we shall speak together what are you then determined to do even by the rule of that philosophy by which i did blame cato for the death which he did give himself i know not how but i do find it cowardly and vile for fear of what might fall so to prevent the time of life arming myself with patience to stay the providence of some high powers that govern us below then if we lose this battle you are contented to be led in triumph thorough the streets of rome no cassius no think not thou noble roman that ever brutus will go bound to rome he bears too great a mind but this same day must end that work the ides of march begun and whether we shall meet again i know not therefore our everlasting farewell take for ever and for ever farewell cassius if we do meet again why we shall smile if not why then this parting was well made for ever and for ever farewell brutus if we do meet again we 'll smile indeed if not tis true this parting was well made why then lead on o that a man might know the end of this day 's business ere it come but it sufficeth that the day will end and then the end is known come ho away exeunt scene ii the same the field of battle alarum enter brutus and messala ride ride messala ride and give these bills unto the legions on the other side loud alarum let them set on at once for i perceive but cold demeanor in octavius wing and sudden push gives them the overthrow ride ride messala let them all come down exeunt scene iii another part of the field alarums enter cassius and titinius o look titinius look the villains fly myself have to mine own turn'd enemy this ensign here of mine was turning back i slew the coward and did take it from him o cassius brutus gave the word too early who having some advantage on octavius took it too eagerly his soldiers fell to spoil whilst we by antony are all enclosed enter pindarus fly further off my lord fly further off mark antony is in your tents my lord fly therefore noble cassius fly far off this hill is far enough look look titinius are those my tents where i perceive the fire they are my lord titinius if thou lovest me mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him till he have brought thee up to yonder troops and here again that i may rest assured whether yond troops are friend or enemy i will be here again even with a thought exit go pindarus get higher on that hill my sight was ever thick regard titinius and tell me what thou notest about the field pindarus ascends the hill this day i breathed first time is come round and where i did begin there shall i end my life is run his compass sirrah what news above   o my lord what news above   titinius is enclosed round about with horsemen that make to him on the spur yet he spurs on now they are almost on him now titinius now some light o he lights too he 's ta'en shout and hark they shout for joy come down behold no more o coward that i am to live so long to see my best friend ta'en before my face pindarus descends come hither sirrah in parthia did i take thee prisoner and then i swore thee saving of thy life that whatsoever i did bid thee do thou shouldst attempt it come now keep thine oath now be a freeman and with this good sword that ran through caesar 's bowels search this bosom stand not to answer here take thou the hilts and when my face is cover'd as tis now guide thou the sword pindarus stabs him caesar thou art revenged even with the sword that kill'd thee dies so i am free yet would not so have been durst i have done my will o cassius far from this country pindarus shall run where never roman shall take note of him exit re enter titinius with messala it is but change titinius for octavius is overthrown by noble brutus power as cassius legions are by antony these tidings will well comfort cassius where did you leave him all disconsolate with pindarus his bondman on this hill is not that he t hat lies upon the ground he lies not like the living o my heart is not that he no this was he messala but cassius is no more o setting sun as in thy red rays thou dost sink to night so in his red blood cassius day is set the sun of rome is set our day is gone clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done mistrust of my success hath done this deed mistrust of good success hath done this deed o hateful error

guilders to redeem their lives have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods excludes all pity from our threatening looks for since the mortal and intestine jars twixt thy seditious countrymen and us it hath in solemn synods been decreed both by the syracusians and ourselves to admit no traffic to our adverse towns nay more if any born at ephesus be seen at any syracusian marts and fairs again if any syracusian born come to the bay of ephesus he dies his goods confiscate to the duke 's dispose unless a thousand marks be levied to quit the penalty and to ransom him thy substance valued at the highest rate can not amount unto a hundred marks therefore by law thou art condemned to die yet this my comfort when your words are done my woes end likewise with the evening sun well syracusian say in brief the cause why thou departed'st from thy native home and for what cause thou camest to ephesus a heavier task could not have been imposed than i to speak my griefs unspeakable yet that the world may witness that my end was wrought by nature not by vile offence i 'll utter what my sorrows give me leave in syracusa was i born and we d unto a woman happy but for me and by me had not our hap been bad with her i lived in joy our wealth increased by prosperous voyages i often made to epidamnum till my factor 's death and the great care of goods at random left drew me from kind embracements of my spouse from whom my absence was not six months old before herself almost at fainting under the pleasing punishment that women bear had made provision for her following me and soon and safe arrived where i was there had she not been long but she became a joyful mother of two goodly sons and which was strange the one so like the other as could not be distinguish'd but by names that very hour and in the self same inn a meaner woman was delivered of such a burden male twins both alike those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,-- i bought and brought up to attend my sons my wife not meanly proud of two such boys made daily motions for our home return unwilling i agreed alas too soon we came aboard a league from epidamnum had we sail'd before the always wind obeying deep gave any tragic instance of our harm but longer did we not retain much hope for what obscured light the heavens did grant did but convey unto our fearful minds a doubtful warrant of immediate death which though myself would gladly have embraced yet the incessant weepings of my wife weeping before for what she saw must come and piteous plainings of the pretty babes that mourn'd for fashion ignorant what to fear forced me to seek delays for them and me and this it was for other means was none the sailors sought for safety by our boat and left the ship then sinking ripe to us my wife more careful for the latter born had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast such as seafaring men provide for storms to him one of the other twins was bound whilst i had been like heedful of the other the children thus disposed my wife and i fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast and floating straight obedient to the stream was carried towards corinth as we thought at length the sun gazing upon the earth dispersed those vapours that offended us and by the benefit of his wished light the seas wax'd calm and we discovered two ships from far making amain to us of corinth that of epidaurus this but ere they came,--o let me say no more gather the sequel by that went before nay forward old man do not break off so for we may pity though not pardon thee o had the gods done so i had not now worthily term'd them merciless to us for ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues we were encounterd by a mighty rock which being violently borne upon our helpful ship was splitted in the midst so that in this unjust divorce of us fortune had left to both of us alike what to delight in what to sorrow for her part poor soul seeming as burdened with lesser weight but not with lesser woe was carried with more speed before the wind and in our sight they three were taken up by fishermen of corinth as we thought at length another ship had seized on us and knowing whom it was their hap to save gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests and would have reft the fishers of their prey had not their bark been very slow of sail and therefore homeward did they bend their course thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss that by misfortunes was my life prolong'd to tell sad stories of my own mishaps and for the sake of them thou sorrowest for do me the favour to dilate at full what hath befall'n of them and thee till now my youngest boy and yet my eldest care at eighteen years became inquisitive after his brother and importuned me that his attendant so his case was like reft of his brother but retain'd his name-- might bear him company in the quest of him whom whilst i labour'd of a love to see i hazarded the loss of whom i loved five summers have i spent in furthest greece roaming clean through the bounds of asia and coasting homeward came to ephesus hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought or that or any place that

vestments his affections bait that 's not my fault he 's master of my state what ruins are in me that can be found by him not ruin'd then is he the ground of my defeatures my decayed fair a sunny look

his eye doth homage otherwhere or else what lets it but he would be here sister you know he promised me a chain would that alone alone he would detain so he would keep fair quarter with his bed i see the jewel best enamelled will lose his beauty yet the gold bides still that others touch and often touching will wear gold and no man that hath a name by falsehood and corruption doth it shame since

for a periwig and recover the lost hair of another man antipholus why is time such a niggard of hair being as it is so plentiful an excrement because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit antipholus why but there 's many a man hath more hair than wit not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair antipholus why thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit the plainer dealer the sooner lost yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity antipholus for what reason for two and sound ones too antipholus nay not sound i pray you sure ones then antipholus nay not sure in a thing falsing certain ones then antipholus name them the one to save the money that he spends in trimming the other that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge antipholus you would all this time have proved there is no time for all things marry and did sir namely no time to recover hair lost by nature antipholus but your

neck which he forswore most monstrously to have good sir draw near to me i 'll speak to him signior antipholus i wonder much that you would put me to this shame and trouble and not without some scandal to yourself with circumstance and oaths so to deny this chain which now you wear so openly beside the charge the shame imprisonment you have done wrong to this my honest friend who but for staying on our controversy had hoisted sail and put to sea to day this chain you had of me can you deny it antipholus i think i had i never did deny it yes that you did sir and forswore it too antipholus who heard me to deny it or forswear it these ears of mine thou know'st did hear thee fie on thee wretch tis pity that thou livest to walk where any honest man resort antipholus thou art a

let us come in that we may bind him fast and bear him home for his recovery i knew he was not in his perfect wits i am sorry now that i did draw on him how long hath this possession held the man this week he hath been heavy sour sad and much different from the man he was but till this afternoon his passion ne'er brake into extremity of rage hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea buried some dear friend hath not else his eye stray'd his affection in unlawful love a sin prevailing much in youthful men who give their eyes the liberty of gazing which of these sorrows is he subject to to none of these except it be the last namely some love that drew him oft from home you should for that have reprehended him why so i did ay but not rough enough as roughly as my modesty would let me haply in private and in assemblies too ay but not enough it was the copy of our conference in bed he slept not for my urging it at board he fed not for my urging it alone it was the subject of my theme in company i often glanced it still did i tell him it was vile and bad and thereof came it that the man was mad the venom clamours of a jealous woman poisons more deadly than a mad dog 's tooth it seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing and therefore comes it that his head is light thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings unquiet meals make ill digestions thereof the raging fire of fever bred and what 's a fever but a fit of madness thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls sweet recreation barr'd what doth ensue but moody and dull melancholy kinsman to grim and comfortless despair and at her heels a huge infectious troop of pale distemperatures and foes to life in food in sport and life preserving rest to be disturb'd would mad or man or beast the consequence is then thy jealous fits have scared thy husband from the use of wits she never reprehended him but mildly when he demean'd himself rough rude and wildly why bear you these rebukes and answer not she did betray me to my own reproof good people enter and lay hold on him no not a creature enters in my house then let your servants bring my husband forth neither he took this place for sanctuary and it shall privilege him from your hands till i have brought him to his wits again or lose my labour in assaying it i will attend my husband be his nurse diet his sickness for it is my office and will have no attorney but myself and therefore let me have him home with me be patient for i will not let him stir till i have used the approved means i have with wholesome syrups drugs and holy prayers to make of him a formal man again it is a branch and parcel of mine oath a charitable duty of my order therefore depart and leave him here with me i will not hence and leave my husband here and ill it doth beseem your holiness to separate the husband and the wife be quiet and depart thou shalt not have him exit complain unto the duke of this indignity come go i will fall prostrate at his feet and never rise until my tears and prayers have won his grace to come in person hither and take perforce my husband from the abbess by this i think the dial points at five anon i 'm sure the duke himself in person comes this way to the melancholy vale the place of death and sorry execution behind the ditches of the abbey here upon what cause to see a reverend syracusian merchant who put unluckily into this bay against the laws and statutes of this town beheaded publicly for his offence see where they come we will behold his death kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey enter duke solinus attended aegeon bareheaded with the headsman and other officers yet once again proclaim it publicly if any friend will pay the sum for him he shall not die so much we tender him justice most sacred duke against the abbess she is a virtuous and a reverend lady it can not be that she hath done thee wrong may it please your grace antipholus my husband whom i made lord of me and all i had at your important letters,--this ill day a most outrageous fit of madness took him that desperately he hurried through the street with him his bondman all as mad as he-- doing displeasure to the citizens by rushing in their houses bearing thence rings jewels any thing his rage did like once did i get him bound and sent him home whilst to take order for the wrongs i went that here and there his fury had committed anon i wot not by what strong escape he broke from those that had the guard of him and with his mad attendant and himself each one with ireful passion with drawn swords met us again and madly bent on us chased us away till raising of more aid we came again to bind them then they fled into this abbey whither we pursued them and here the abbess shuts the gates on us and will not suffer us to fetch him out nor send him forth that we may bear him hence therefore most gracious duke with thy command let him be brought forth and borne hence for help long since thy husband served me in my wars and i to thee engaged a prince 's word when thou didst make him master of thy bed to do him all the grace and good i could go some of you knock at the abbey gate and bid the lady abbess come to me i will determine this before i stir enter a servant o mistress mistress shift and save yourself my master and his man are both broke loose beaten the maids a row and bound the doctor whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire and ever as it blazed they threw on him great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair my master preaches patience to him and the while his man with scissors nicks him like a fool and sure unless you send some present help between them they will kill the conjurer peace fool thy master and his man are here and that is false thou dost report to

disturbed with the effect of wine nor heady rash provoked with raging ire albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad this woman lock'd me out this day from dinner that goldsmith there were he not pack'd with her could witness it for he was with me then who parted with me to go fetch a chain promising to bring it to the porpentine where balthazar and i did dine together our dinner done and he not coming thither i went to seek him in the street i met him and in his company that gentleman there did this perjured goldsmith swear me down that i this day of him received the chain which god he knows i saw not for the which he did arrest me with an officer i did obey and sent my peasant home for certain ducats he with none return'd then fairly i bespoke the officer to go in person with me to my house by the way we met my wife her sister and a rabble more of vile confederates along with them they brought one pinch a hungry lean faced villain a mere anatomy a mountebank a threadbare juggler

twere outfacing me cries out i was possess'd then all together they fell upon me bound me bore me thence and in a dark and dankish vault at home there left me and my man both bound together till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder i gain'd my freedom and immediately ran hither to your grace whom i beseech to give me ample satisfaction for these deep shames and great indignities my lord in truth thus far i witness with him that he dined not at home but was lock'd out but had he such a chain of thee or no he had my lord and when he ran in here these people saw the chain about his neck besides i will be sworn these ears of mine heard you confess you had the chain of him after you first forswore it on the mart and thereupon i drew my sword on you and then you fled into this abbey here from whence i think you are come by miracle antipholus i never came within these abbey walls nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me i never saw the chain so help me heaven and this is false you

done since last we saw in france i thank your grace healthful and ever since a fresh admirer of what i saw there an untimely ague stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when those suns of glory those two lights of men met in the vale of andren twixt guynes and arde i was then present saw them salute on horseback beheld them when they lighted how they clung in their embracement as they grew together which had they what four throned ones could have weigh'd such a compounded one all the whole time i was my chamber 's prisoner then you lost the view of earthly glory men might say till this time pomp was single but now married to one above itself each following day became the next day 's master till the last made former wonders its to day the french all clinquant all in gold like heathen gods shone down the english and to morrow they made britain india every man that stood show'd like a mine their dwarfish pages were as cherubins all guilt the madams too not used to toil did almost sweat

disposing of it nought rebell'd order gave each thing view the office did distinctly his full function who did guide i mean who set the body and the limbs of this great sport together as you guess one certes that promises no element in such a business i pray you who my lord all this was order'd by the good discretion of the right reverend cardinal of york the devil speed him no man 's pie is freed from his ambitious finger what had he to do in these fierce vanities i wonder that such a keech can with his very bulk take up the rays o the beneficial sun and keep it from the earth surely sir there 's in him stuff that puts him to these ends for being not propp'd by ancestry whose grace chalks successors their way nor call'd upon for high feats done to the crown neither allied for eminent assistants but spider like out of his self drawing web he gives us note the force of his own merit makes his way a gift that heaven gives for him which buys a place next to the king i can not tell what heaven hath given him,--let some graver eye pierce into that but i can see his pride peep through each part of him whence has he that if not from hell the devil is a niggard or has given all before and he begins a new hell in himself why the devil upon this french going out took he upon him without the privity o the king to appoint who should attend on him he makes up the file of all the gentry for the most part such to whom as great a charge as little honour he meant to lay upon and his own letter the honourable board of council out must fetch him in the papers i do know kinsmen of mine three at the least that have by this so sickened their estates that never they shall abound as formerly o many have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em for this great journey what did this vanity but minister communication of a most poor issue grievingly i think the peace between the french and us not values the cost that did conclude it every man after the hideous storm that follow'd was a thing inspired and not consulting broke into a general prophecy that this tempest dashing the garment of this peace aboded the sudden breach on't which is budded out for france hath flaw'd the league and hath attach'd our merchants goods at bourdeaux is it therefore the ambassador is silenced marry is't a proper title of a peace and purchased at a superfluous rate why all this business our reverend cardinal carried like it your grace the state takes notice of the private difference betwixt you and the cardinal i advise you-- and take it from a heart that wishes towards you honour and plenteous safety that you read the cardinal 's malice and his potency together to consider further that what his high hatred would effect wants not a minister in his power you know his nature that he 's revengeful and i know his sword hath a sharp edge it 's long and t may be said it reaches far and where twill not extend thither he darts it bosom up my counsel you 'll find it wholesome lo where comes that rock that i advise your shunning enter cardinal wolsey the purse borne before him   certain of the guard and two secretaries with   papers cardinal wolsey in his passage

choler question what tis you go about to climb steep hills requires slow pace at first anger is like a full hot horse who being allow'd his way self mettle tires him not a man in england can advise me

til run o'er in seeming to augment it wastes it be advised i say again there is no english soul more stronger to direct you than yourself if with the sap of reason you would quench or but allay the fire of passion sir i am thankful to you and i 'll go along by your prescription but this top proud fellow whom from the flow of gall i name not but from sincere motions by intelligence and proofs as clear as founts in july when we see each grain of gravel i do know to be corrupt and treasonous say not treasonous to the king i 'll say't and make my vouch as strong as shore of rock attend this holy fox or wolf or both,--for he is equal ravenous as he is subtle and as prone to mischief as able to perform't his mind and place infecting one another yea reciprocally-- only to show his pomp as well in france as here at home suggests the king our master to this last costly treaty the interview that swallow'd so much treasure and like a glass did break i the rinsing faith and so it did pray give me favour sir this cunning cardinal the articles o the combination drew as himself pleased and they were ratified as he cried thus let be to as much end as give a crutch to the dead but our count cardinal has done this and tis well for worthy wolsey who can not err he did it now this follows,-- which as i take it is a kind of puppy to the old dam treason,--charles the emperor under pretence to see the queen his aunt-- for twas indeed his colour but he came to whisper wolsey,--here makes visitation his fears were that the interview betwixt england and france might through their amity breed him some prejudice for from this league peep'd harms that menaced him he privily deals with our cardinal and as i trow,-- which i do well for i am sure the emperor paid ere he promised whereby his suit was granted ere it was ask'd but when the way was made and paved with gold the emperor thus desired that he would please to alter the king 's course and break the foresaid peace let the king know as soon he shall by me that thus the cardinal does buy and sell his honour as he pleases and for his own advantage i am sorry to hear this of him and could wish he were something mistaken in't no not a syllable i   do pronounce him in that very shape he shall appear in proof enter brandon a sergeant at arms before him and two or three of the guard your office sergeant execute it sir my lord the duke of buckingham and earl of hereford stafford and northampton i arrest thee of high treason in the name of our most sovereign king lo you my lord the net has fall'n upon me i shall perish under device and practise i am sorry to see you ta'en from liberty to look on the business present tis his highness pleasure you shall to the tower it will help me nothing to plead mine innocence for that dye is on me which makes my whitest part black the will of heaven be done in this and all things i obey o my lord abergavenny fare you well nay he must bear you company the king to abergavenny is pleased you shall to the tower till you know how he determines further as the duke said the will of heaven be done and the king 's pleasure by me obey'd here is a warrant from the king to attach lord montacute and the bodies of the duke 's confessor john de la car one gilbert peck his chancellor-- so so these are the limbs o the plot no more i hope a monk o the chartreux o nicholas hopkins he my

and in that love not unconsider'd leave your honour nor the dignity of your office is the point of my petition lady mine proceed i am solicited not by a few and those of true condition that your subjects are in great grievance there have been commissions sent down among 'em which hath flaw'd the heart of all their loyalties wherein although my good lord cardinal they vent reproaches most bitterly on you as putter on of these exactions yet the king our master-- whose honour heaven shield from soil!--even he escapes not language unmannerly yea such which breaks the sides of loyalty and almost appears in loud rebellion not almost appears it doth appear for upon these taxations the clothiers all not able to maintain the many to them longing have put off the spinsters carders fullers weavers who unfit for other life compell'd by hunger and lack of other means in desperate manner daring the event to the teeth are all in uproar and danger serves among then taxation wherein and what taxation my lord cardinal you that are blamed for it alike with us know you of this taxation please you sir i know but of a single part in aught pertains to the state and front but in that file where others tell steps with me no my lord you know no more than others but you frame things that are known alike which are not wholesome to those which would not know them and yet must perforce be their acquaintance these exactions whereof my sovereign would have note they are most pestilent to the bearing and to bear 'em the back is sacrifice to the load they say they are devised by you or else you suffer too hard an exclamation still exaction the nature of it in what kind let 's know is this exaction i am much too venturous in tempting of your patience but am bolden'd under your promised pardon the subjects grief comes through commissions which compel from each the sixth part of his substance to be levied without delay and the pretence for this is named your wars in france this makes bold mouths tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze allegiance in them their curses now live where their prayers did and it 's come to pass this tractable obedience is a slave to each incensed will i would your highness would give it quick consideration for there is no primer business by my life this is against our pleasure and for me i have no further gone in this than by a single voice and that not pass'd me but by learned approbation of the judges if i am traduced by ignorant tongues which neither know my faculties nor person yet will be the chronicles of my doing let me say tis but the fate of place and the rough brake that virtue must go through we must not stint our necessary actions in the fear to cope malicious censurers which ever as ravenous fishes do a vessel follow that is new trimm'd but benefit no further than vainly longing what we oft do best by sick interpreters once weak ones is not ours or not allow'd what worst as oft hitting a grosser quality is cried up for our best act if we shall stand still in fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at we should take root here where we sit or sit state statues only things done well and with a care exempt themselves from fear things done without example in their issue are to be fear'd have you a precedent of this commission i believe not any we must not rend our subjects from our laws and stick them in our will sixth part of each a trembling contribution why we take from every tree lop bark and part o the timber and though we leave it with a root thus hack'd the air will drink the sap to every county where this is question'd send our letters with free pardon to each man that has denied the force of this commission pray look to't i put it to your care a word with you to the secretary let there be letters writ to every shire of the king 's grace and pardon the grieved commons hardly conceive of me let it be noised that through our intercession this revokement and pardon comes i shall anon advise you further in the proceeding exit secretary enter surveyor i am sorry that the duke of buckingham is run in your displeasure it grieves many the gentleman is learn'd and a most rare speaker to nature none more bound his training such that he may furnish and instruct great teachers and never seek for aid out of himself yet see when these so noble benefits shall prove not well disposed the mind growing once corrupt they turn to vicious forms ten times more ugly than ever they were fair this man so complete who was enroll'd mongst wonders and when we almost with ravish'd listening could not find his hour of speech a minute he my lady hath into monstrous habits put the graces that once were his and is become as black as if besmear'd in hell sit by us you shall hear-- this was his gentleman in trust of him things to strike honour sad bid him recount the fore recited practises whereof we can not feel too little hear too much stand forth and with bold spirit relate what you most like a careful subject have collected out of the duke of buckingham speak freely first it was usual with him every day it would infect his speech that if the king should without issue die he 'll carry it so to make the sceptre his these very words i 've heard him utter to his son in law lord abergavenny to whom by oath he menaced revenge upon the cardinal please your highness note this dangerous conception in this point not friended by by his wish to your high person his will is most malignant and it stretches beyond you to your friends my learn'd lord cardinal deliver all with charity speak on how grounded he his title to the crown upon our fail to this point hast thou heard him at any time speak aught he was brought to this by a vain prophecy of nicholas hopkins what was that hopkins sir a chartreux friar his confessor who fed him every minute with words of sovereignty how know'st thou this not long before your highness sped to france the duke being at the rose within the parish saint lawrence poultney did of me demand what was the speech among the londoners concerning the french journey i replied men fear'd the french would prove perfidious to the king 's danger presently the duke said twas the fear indeed and that he doubted twould prove the verity of certain words spoke by a holy monk that oft says he hath sent to me wishing me to permit john de la car my chaplain a choice hour to hear from him a matter of some moment whom after under the confession 's seal he solemnly had sworn that what he spoke my chaplain to no creature living but to me should utter with demure confidence this pausingly ensued neither the king nor 's heirs tell you the duke shall prosper bid him strive to gain the love o the commonalty the duke shall govern england if i know you well you were the duke 's surveyor and lost your office on the complaint o the tenants take good heed you charge not in your spleen a noble person and spoil your nobler soul i say take heed yes heartily beseech you let him on go forward on my soul i 'll speak but truth i told my lord the duke by the devil 's illusions the monk might be deceived and that twas dangerous for him to ruminate on this so far until it forged him some design which being believed it was much like to do he answer'd tush it can do me no damage adding further that had the king in his last sickness fail'd the cardinal 's and sir thomas lovell 's heads should have gone off ha what so rank ah ha there 's mischief in this man canst thou say further i can my liege proceed being at greenwich after your highness had reproved the duke about sir william blomer,-- i remember of such a time being my sworn servant the duke retain'd him his but on what hence if quoth he i for this had been committed as to the tower i thought i would have play'd the part my father meant to act upon the usurper richard who being at salisbury made suit to come in 's presence which if granted as he made semblance of his duty would have put his knife to him a giant traitor now madam may his highness live in freedom and this man out of prison god mend all there 's something more would out of thee what say'st after the duke his father with the knife he stretch'd him and with one hand on his dagger another spread on 's breast mounting his eyes he did discharge a horrible oath whose tenor was,--were he evil used he would outgo his father by as much as a performance does an irresolute purpose there 's his period to sheathe his knife in us he is attach'd call him to present trial if he may find mercy in the law tis his if none let him not seek t of us by day and night he 's traitor to the height exeunt scene iii an ante chamber in the palace enter chamberlain and sands is't possible the spells of france should juggle men into such strange mysteries new customs though they be never so ridiculous nay let 'em be unmanly yet are follow'd as far as i see all the good our english have got by the late voyage is but merely a fit or two o the face but they are shrewd ones for when they hold 'em you would swear directly their very noses had been counsellors to pepin or clotharius they keep state so they have all new legs and lame ones one would take it that never saw 'em pace before the spavin or springhalt reign'd among 'em death my lord their clothes are after such a pagan cut too that sure they 've worn out christendom enter lovell how now what news sir thomas lovell faith my lord i hear of none but the new proclamation that 's clapp'd upon the court gate what is't for the reformation of our travell'd gallants that fill the court with quarrels talk and tailors i 'm glad tis there now i would pray our monsieurs to think an english courtier may be wise and never see the louvre they must

favour let the music knock it exeunt with trumpets act ii scene i. westminster a street enter two gentlemen meeting whither away so fast o god save ye even to the hall to hear what shall become of the great duke of buckingham i 'll save you that labour sir all 's now done but the ceremony of bringing back the prisoner were you there yes indeed was i. pray speak what has happen'd you may guess quickly what is he found guilty yes truly is he and condemn'd upon't i am sorry for't so are a number more but pray how pass'd it i 'll tell you in a little the great duke came to the bar where to his accusations he pleaded still not guilty and alleged many sharp reasons to defeat the law the king 's attorney on the contrary urged on the examinations proofs confessions of divers witnesses which the duke desired to have brought viva voce to his face at which appear'd against him his surveyor sir gilbert peck his chancellor and john car confessor to him with that devil monk hopkins that made this mischief that was he that fed him with his prophecies the same all these accused him strongly which he fain would have flung from him but indeed he could not and so his peers upon this evidence have found him guilty of high treason much he spoke and learnedly for life but all was either pitied in him or forgotten after all this how did he bear himself when he was brought again to the bar to hear his knell rung out his judgment he was stirr'd with such an agony he sweat extremely and something spoke in choler ill and hasty but he fell to himself again and sweetly in all the rest show'd a most noble patience i do not think he fears death sure he does not he never was so womanish the cause he may a little grieve at certainly the cardinal is the end of this tis likely by all conjectures first kildare 's attainder then deputy of ireland who removed earl surrey was sent thither and in haste too lest he should help his father that trick of state was a deep envious one at his return no doubt he will requite it this is noted and generally whoever the king favours the cardinal instantly will find employment and far enough from court too all the commons hate him perniciously and o my conscience wish him ten fathom deep this duke as much they love and dote on call him bounteous buckingham the mirror of all courtesy;-- stay there sir and see the noble ruin'd man you speak of enter buckingham from his arraignment tip staves   before him the axe with the edge towards him   halberds on each side accompanied with lovell vaux sands and common people let 's stand close and behold him all good people you that thus far have come to pity me hear what i say and then go home and lose me i have this day received a traitor 's judgment and by that name must die yet heaven bear witness and if i have a co nscience let it sink me even as the axe falls if i be not faithful the law i bear no malice for my death t has done upon the premises but justice but those that sought it i could wish more christians be what they will i heartily forgive 'em yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief nor build their evils on the graves of great men for then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em for further life in this world i ne'er hope nor will i sue although the king have mercies more than i dare make faults you few that loved me and dare be bold to weep for buckingham his noble friends and fellows whom to leave is only bitter to him only dying go with me like good angels to my end and as the long divorce of steel falls on me make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice and lift my soul to heaven lead on o god 's name i do beseech your grace for charity if ever any malice in your heart were hid against me now to forgive me frankly sir thomas lovell i as free forgive you as i would be forgiven i forgive all there can not be those numberless offences gainst me that i can not take peace with no black envy shall mark my grave commend me to his grace and if he speak of buckingham pray tell him you met him half in heaven my vows and prayers yet are the king 's and till my soul forsake shall cry for blessings on him may he live longer than i have time to tell his years ever beloved and loving may his rule be and when old time shall lead him to his end goodness and he fill up one monument to the water side i must conduct your grace then give my charge up to sir nicholas vaux who undertakes you to your end prepare there the duke is coming see the barge be ready and fit it with such furniture as suits the greatness of his person nay sir nicholas let it alone my state now will but mock me when i came hither i was lord high constable and duke of buckingham now poor edward bohun yet i am richer than my base accusers that never knew what truth meant i now seal it and with that blood will make 'em one day groan for't my noble father henry of buckingham who first raised head against usurping richard flying for succor to his servant banister being distress'd was by that wretch betray'd and without trial fell god 's peace be with him henry the seventh succeeding truly pitying my father 's loss like a most royal prince restored me to my honours and out of ruins made my name once more noble now his son henry the eighth life honour name and all that made me happy at one stroke has taken for ever from the world i had my trial and must needs say a noble one which makes me a little happier than my wretched father yet thus far we are one in fortunes both fell by our servants by those men we loved most a most unnatural and faithless service heaven has an end in all yet you that hear me this from a dying man receive as certain where you are liberal of your loves and counsels be sure you be not loose for those you make friends and give your hearts to when they once perceive the least rub in your fortunes fall away like water from ye never found again but where they mean to sink ye all good people pray for me i must now forsake ye the last hour of my long weary life is come upon me farewell and when you would say something that is sad speak how i fell i have done and god forgive me exeunt buckingham and train o this is full of pity sir it calls i fear too many curses on their beads that were the authors if the duke be guiltless tis full of woe yet i can give you inkling of an ensuing evil if it fall greater than this good angels keep it from us what may it be you do not doubt my faith sir this secret is so weighty twill require a strong faith to conceal it let me have it i do not talk much i am confident you shall sir did you not of late days hear a buzzing of a separation between the king and katharine yes but it held not for when the king once heard it out of anger he sent command to the lord mayor straight to stop the rumor and allay those tongues that durst disperse it but that slander sir is found a truth now for it grows again fresher than e'er it was and held for certain the king will venture at it either the cardinal or some about him near have out of malice to the good queen possess'd him with a scruple that will undo her to confirm this too cardinal campeius is arrived and lately as all think for this business tis the cardinal and merely to revenge him on the emperor for not bestowing on him at his asking the archbishopric of toledo this is purposed i think you have hit the mark but is't not cruel that she should feel the smart of this the cardinal will have his will and she must fall tis woful we are too open here to argue this let 's think in private more exeunt scene ii an ante chamber in the palace enter chamberlain reading a letter my lord the horses your lordship sent for with all the care i had i saw well chosen ridden and furnished they were young and handsome and of the best breed in the north when they were ready to set out for london a man of my lord cardinal 's by commission and main power took 'em from me with this reason his master would be served before a subject if not before the king which stopped our mouths sir i fear he will indeed well let him have them he will have all i think enter to chamberlain norfolk and suffolk well met my lord chamberlain good day to both your graces how is the king employ'd i left him private full of sad thoughts and troubles what 's the cause it seems the marriage with his brother 's wife has crept too near his conscience no his conscience has crept too near another lady tis so this is the cardinal 's doing the king cardinal that blind priest like the eldest son of fortune turns what he list the king will know him one day pray god he do he 'll never know himself else how holily he works in all his business and with what zeal for now he has crack'd the league between us and the emperor the queen 's great nephew he dives into the king 's soul and there scatters dangers doubts wringing of the conscience fears and despairs and all these for his marriage and out of all these to restore the king he counsels a divorce a loss of her that like a jewel has hung twenty years about his neck yet never lost her lustre of her that loves him with that excellence that angels love good men with even of her that when the greatest stroke of fortune falls will bless the king and is not this course pious heaven keep me from such counsel tis most true these news are every where every tongue speaks 'em and every true heart weeps for't all that dare look into these affairs see this main end the french king 's sister heaven will one day open the king 's eyes that so long have slept upon this bold bad man and free us from his slavery we had need pray and heartily for our deliverance or this imperious man will work us all from princes into pages all men 's honours lie like one lump before him to be fashion'd into what pitch he please for me my lords i love him not nor fear him there 's my creed as i am made without him so i 'll stand if the king please his curses and his blessings touch me alike they 're breath i not believe in i knew him and i know him so i leave him to him that made him proud the pope let 's in and with some other business put the king from these sad thoughts that work too much upon him my lord you 'll bear us company excuse me the king has sent me otherwhere besides you 'll find a most unfit time to disturb him health to your lordships thanks my good lord chamberlain exit chamberlain

was so virtuous kept him a foreign man still which so grieved him that he ran mad and died heaven 's peace be with him that 's christian care enough for living murmurers there 's places of rebuke he was a fool for he would needs be virtuous that good fellow if i command him follows my appointment i will have none so near else learn this brother we live not to be grip'd by meaner persons deliver this with modesty to the queen exit gardiner the most convenient place that i can think of for such receipt of learning is black friars there ye shall meet about this weighty business my wolsey see it furnish'd o my lord would it not grieve an able man to leave so sweet a bedfellow but conscience conscience o tis a tender place and i must leave her exeunt scene iii an ante chamber of the queen 's apartments enter anne and an old lady not for that neither here 's the pang that pinches his highness having lived so long with her and she so good a lady that no tongue could ever pronounce dishonour of her by my life she never knew harm doing o now after so many courses of the sun enthroned still growing in a majesty and pomp the which to leave a thousand fold more bitter than tis sweet at first to acquire,--after this process to give her the avaunt it is a pity would move a monster hearts of most hard temper melt and lament for her o god 's will much better she ne'er had known pomp though't be temporal yet if that quarrel fortune do divorce it from the bearer tis a sufferance panging as soul and body 's severing alas poor lady she 's a stranger now again so much the more must pity drop upon her verily i swear tis better to be lowly born and range with humble livers in content than to be perk'd up in a glistering grief and wear a golden sorrow our content is our best having by my troth and maidenhead i would not be a queen beshrew me i would and venture maidenhead for't and so would you for all this spice of your hypocrisy you that have so fair parts of woman on you have too a woman 's heart which ever yet affected eminence wealth sovereignty which to say sooth are blessings and which gifts saving your mincing the capacity of your soft cheveril conscience would receive if you might please to stretch it nay good troth yes troth and troth you would not be a queen no not for all the riches under heaven old lady \t tis strange a three pence bow'd would hire me old as i am

desire you do me right and justice and to bestow your pity on me for i am a most poor woman and a stranger born out of your dominions having here no judge indifferent nor no more assurance of equal friendship and proceeding alas sir in what have i offended you what cause hath my behavior given to your displeasure that thus you should proceed to put me off and take your good grace from me heaven witness i have been to you a true and humble wife at all times to your will conformable ever in fear to kindle your dislike yea subject to your countenance glad or sorry as i saw it inclined when was the hour i ever contradicted your desire or made it not mine too or which of your friends have i not strove to love although i knew he were mine enemy what friend of mine that had to him derived your anger did i continue in my liking nay gave notice he was from thence discharged sir call to mind that i have been your wife in this obedience upward of twenty years and have been blest with many children by you if in the course and process of this time you can report and prove it too against mine honour aught my bond to wedlock or my love and duty against your sacred person in god 's name turn me away and let the foul'st contempt shut door upon me and so give me up to the sharp'st kind of justice please you sir the king your father was reputed for a prince most prudent of an excellent and unmatch'd wit and judgment ferdinand my father king of spain was reckon'd one the wisest prince that there had reign'd by many a year before it is not to be question'd that they had gather'd a wise council to them of every realm that did debate this business who deem'd our marriage lawful wherefore i humbly beseech you sir to spare me till i may be by my friends in spain advised whose counsel i will implore if not i the name of god your pleasure be fulfill'd you have here lady and of your choice these reverend fathers men of singular integrity and learning yea the elect o the land who are assembled to plead your cause it shall be therefore bootless that longer you desire the court as well for your own quiet as to rectify what is unsettled in the king his grace hath spoken well and justly therefore madam it 's fit this royal session do proceed and that without delay their arguments be now produced and heard lord cardinal to you i speak your pleasure madam sir i am about to weep but thinking that we are a queen or long have dream'd so certain the daughter of a king my drops of tears i 'll turn to sparks of fire be patient yet i will when you are humble nay before or god will punish me i do believe induced by potent circumstances that you are mine enemy and make my challenge you shall not be my judge for it is you have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me which god 's dew quench therefore i say again i utterly abhor yea from my soul refuse you for my judge whom yet once more i hold my most malicious foe and think not at all a friend to truth i do profess you speak not like yourself who ever yet have stood to charity and display'd the effects of disposition gentle and of wisdom o'ertopping woman 's power madam you do me wrong i have no spleen against you nor injustice for you or any how far i have proceeded or how far further shall is warranted by a commission from the consistory yea the whole consistory of rome you charge me that i have blown this coal i do deny it the king is present if it be known to him that i gainsay my deed how may he wound and worthily my falsehood yea as much as you have done my truth if he know that i am free of your report he knows i am not of your wrong therefore in him it lies to cure me and the cure is to remove these thoughts from you the which before his highness shall speak in i do beseech you gracious madam to unthink your speaking and to say so no more my lord my lord i am a simple woman much too weak to oppose your cunning you 're meek and humble mouth'd you sign your place and calling in full seeming with meekness and humility but your heart is cramm'd with arrogancy spleen and pride you have by fortune and his highness favours gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted where powers are your retainers and your words domestics to you serve your will as't please yourself pronounce their office i must tell you you tender more your person 's honour than your high profession spiritual that again i do refuse you for my judge and here before you all appeal unto the pope to bring my whole cause fore his holiness and to be judged by him she curtsies to king henry viii and offers to depart the queen is obstinate stubborn to justice apt to accuse it and disdainful to be tried by't tis not well she 's going away call her again katharine queen of england come into the court madam you are call'd back what need you note it pray you keep your way when you are call'd return now the lord help they vex me past my patience pray you pass on i will not tarry no nor ever more upon this business my appearance make in any of their courts exeunt queen katharine and her attendants go thy ways kate that man i the world who shall report he has a better wife let him in nought be trusted for speaking false in that thou art alone if thy rare qualities sweet gentleness thy meekness saint like wife like government obeying in commanding and thy parts sovereign and pious else could speak thee out the queen of earthly queens she 's noble born and like her true nobility she has carried herself towards me most gracious sir in humblest manner i require your highness that it shall please you to declare in hearing of all these ears,--for where i am robb'd and bound there must i be unloosed although not there at once and fully satisfied,--whether ever i did broach this business to your highness or laid any scruple in your way which might induce you to the question on't or ever have to you but with thanks to god for such a royal lady spake one the least word that might be to the prejudice of her present state or touch of her good person my lord cardinal i do excuse you yea upon mine honour i free you from't you are not to be taught that you have many enemies that know not why they are so but like to village curs bark when their fellows do by some of these the queen is put in anger you 're excused but will you be more justified you ever have wish'd the sleeping of this business never desired it to be stirr'd but oft have hinder'd oft the passages made toward it on my honour i speak my good lord cardinal to this point and thus far clear him now what moved me to't i will be bold with time and your attention then mark the inducement thus it came give heed to't my conscience first received a tenderness scruple and prick on certain speeches utter'd by the bishop of bayonne then french ambassador who had been hither sent on the debating a marriage twixt the duke of orleans and our daughter mary i the progress of this business ere a determinate resolution he i mean the bishop did require a respite wherein he might the king his lord advertise whether our daughter were legitimate respecting this our marriage with the dowager sometimes our brother 's wife this respite shook the bosom of my conscience enter'd me yea with a splitting power and made to tremble the region of my breast which forced such way that many mazed considerings did throng and press'd in with this caution first methought i stood not in the smile of heaven who had commanded nature that my lady 's womb if it conceived a male child by me should do no more offices of life to't than the grave does to the dead for her male issue or died where they were made or shortly after this world had air'd them hence i took a thought this was a judgment on me that my kingdom well worthy the best heir o the world should not be gladded in't by me then follows that i weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in by this my issue 's fail and that gave to me many a groaning throe thus hulling in the wild sea of my conscience i did steer toward this remedy whereupon we are now present here together that 's to say i meant to rectify my conscience,--which i then did feel full sick and yet not well,-- by all the reverend fathers of the land and doctors learn'd first i began in private with you my lord of lincoln you remember how under my oppression i did reek when i first moved you very well my liege i have spoke long be pleased yourself to say how far you satisfied me so please your highness the question did at first so stagger me bearing a state of mighty moment in't and consequence of dread that i committed the daring'st counsel which i had to doubt and did entreat your highness to this course which you are running here i then moved you my lord of canterbury and got your leave to make this present summons unsolicited i left no reverend person in this court but by particular consent proceeded under your hands and seals therefore go on for no dislike i the world against the person of the good queen but the sharp thorny points of my alleged reasons drive this forward prove but our marriage lawful by my life and kingly dignity we are contented to wear our mortal state to come with her katharine our queen before the primest creature that 's paragon'd o the world so please your highness the queen being absent tis a needful fitness that we adjourn this court till further day meanwhile must be an earnest motion made to the queen to call back her appeal she intends unto his holiness aside \t i may perceive these cardinals trifle with me i abhor this dilatory sloth and tricks of rome my learn'd and well beloved servant cranmer prithee return with thy approach i know my comfort comes along break up the court i say set on exeunt in manner as they entered act iii scene i. london queen katharine 's apartments enter queen katharine and her women as at work take thy lute wench my soul grows sad with troubles sing and disperse 'em if thou canst

integrity should breed and service to his majesty and you so deep suspicion where all faith was meant we come not by the way of accusation to taint that honour every good tongue blesses nor to betray you any way to sorrow you have too much good lady but to know how you stand minded in the weighty difference between the king and you and to deliver like free and honest men our just opinions and comforts to your cause most honour'd madam my lord of york out of his noble nature zeal and obedience he still bore your grace forgetting like a good man your late censure both of his truth and him which was too far offers as i do in a sign of peace his service and his counsel aside \t to betray me.-- my lords i thank you both for your good wills ye speak like honest men pray god ye prove so but how to make ye suddenly an answer in such a point of weight so near mine honour,-- more near my life i fear,--with my weak wit and to such men of gravity and learning in truth i know not i was set at work among my maids full little god knows looking either for such men or such business for her sake that i have been,--for i feel the last fit of my greatness,--good your graces let me have time and counsel for my cause alas i am a woman friendless hopeless madam you wrong the king 's love with these fears your hopes and friends are infinite in england but little for my profit can you think lords that any englishman dare give me counsel or be a known friend gainst his highness pleasure though he be grown so desperate to be honest and live a subject nay forsooth my friends they that must weigh out my afflictions they that my trust must grow to live not here they are as all my other comforts far hence in mine own country lords i would your grace would leave your griefs and take my counsel how sir put your main cause into the king 's protection he 's loving and most gracious twill be much both for your honour better and your cause for if the trial of the law o'ertake ye you 'll part away disgraced he tells you rightly ye tell me what ye wish for both,--my ruin is this your christian counsel out upon ye heaven is above all yet there sits a judge that no king can corrupt your rage mistakes us the more shame for ye holy men i thought ye upon my soul two reverend cardinal virtues but cardinal sins and hollow hearts i fear ye mend 'em for shame my lords is this your comfort the cordial that ye bring a wretched lady a woman lost among ye laugh'd at scorn'd i will not wish ye half my miseries i have more charity but say i warn'd ye take heed for heaven 's sake take heed lest

me-- if you have any justice any pity if ye be any thing but churchmen 's habits-- put my sick cause into his hands that hates me alas has banish'd me his bed already his love too long ago i am old my lords and all the fellowship i hold now with him is only my obedience what can happen to me above this wretchedness all your studies make me a curse like this your fears are worse have i lived thus long let me speak myself since virtue finds no friends a wife a true one a woman i dare say without vain glory never yet branded with suspicion have i with all my full affections still met the king loved him next heaven obey'd him been out of fondness superstitious to him almost forgot my prayers to content him and am i thus rewarded tis not well lords bring me a constant woman to her husband one that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure and to that woman when she has done most yet will i add an honour a great patience madam you wander from the good we aim at my lord i dare not make myself so guilty to give up willingly that noble title your master we d me to nothing but death shall e'er divorce my dignities pray hear me would i had never trod this english earth or felt the flatteries that grow upon it ye have angels faces but heaven knows your hearts what will become of me now wretched lady i am the most unhappy woman living alas poor wenches where are now your fortunes shipwreck'd upon a kingdom where no pity no friend no hope no kindred weep for me almost no grave allow'd me like the lily that once was mistress of the field and flourish'd i 'll hang my head and perish if your grace could but be brought to know our ends are honest you'ld feel more comfort why should we good lady upon what cause wrong you alas our places the way of our profession is against it we are to cure such sorrows not to sow 'em for goodness sake consider what you do how you may hurt yourself ay utterly grow from the king 's acquaintance by this carriage the hearts of princes kiss obedience so much they love it but to stubborn spirits they swell and grow as terrible as storms i know you have a gentle noble temper a soul as even as a calm pray think us those we profess peace makers friends and servants madam you 'll find it so you wrong your virtues with these weak women 's fears a noble spirit as yours was put into you ever casts such doubts as false coin from it the king loves you beware you lose it not for us if you please to trust us in your business we are ready to use our utmost   studies in your service do what ye will my lords and pray forgive me if i have used myself unmannerly you know i am a woman lacking wit to make a seemly answer to such persons pray do my service to his majesty he has my heart yet and shall have my prayers while i shall have my life come reverend fathers bestow your counsels on me she now begs that little thought when she set footing here she should have bought her dignities so dear exeunt scene ii ante chamber to king henry viii 's apartment enter norfolk suffolk surrey and chamberlain if you will now unite in your complaints and force them with a constancy the cardinal can not stand under them if you omit the offer of this time i can not promise but that you shall sustain moe new disgraces with these you bear already i am joyful to meet the least occasion that may give me remembrance of my father in law the duke to be revenged on him which of the peers have uncontemn'd gone by him or at least strangely neglected when did he regard the stamp of nobleness in any person out of himself my lords you speak your pleasures what he deserves of you and me i know what we can do to him though now the time gives way to us i much fear if you can not bar his access to the king never attempt any thing on him for he hath a witchcraft over the king in 's tongue o fear him not his spell in that is out the king hath found matter against him that for ever mars the honey of his language no he 's settled not to come off in his displeasure sir i should be glad to hear such news as this once every hour believe it this is true in the divorce his contrary proceedings are all unfolded wherein he appears as i would wish mine enemy how came his practises to light most strangely o how how the cardinal 's letters to the pope miscarried and came to the eye o the king wherein was read how that the cardinal did entreat his holiness to stay the judgment o the divorce for if it did take place i do quoth he perceive my king is tangled in affection to a creature of the queen 's lady anne bullen has the king this believe it will this work the king in this perceives him how he coasts and hedges his own way but in this point all his tricks founder and he brings his physic after his patient 's death the king already hath married the fair lady would he had may you be happy in your wish my lord for i profess you have it now all my joy trace the conjunction my amen to't all men 's there 's order given for her coronation marry this is yet but young and may be left to some ears unrecounted but my lords she is a gallant creature and complete in mind and feature i persuade me from her will fall some blessing to this land which shall in it be memorised but will the king digest this letter of the cardinal 's the lord forbid marry amen no no there be moe wasps that buzz about his nose will make this sting the sooner cardinal campeius is stol'n away to rome hath ta'en no leave has left the cause o the king unhandled and is posted as the agent of our cardinal to second all his plot i do assure you the king cried ha at this now god incense him and let him cry ha louder but my lord when returns cranmer he is return'd in his opinions which have satisfied the king for his divorce together with all famous colleges almost in christendom shortly i believe his second marriage shall be publish'd and her coronation katharine no more shall be call'd queen but princess dowager and widow to prince arthur this same cranmer 's a worthy fellow and hath ta'en much pain in the king 's business he has and we shall see him for it an archbishop so i hear tis so the cardinal enter cardinal wolsey and cromwell observe observe he 's moody the packet cromwell gave't you the king to his own hand in 's bedchamber look'd he o the inside of the paper presently he did unseal them and the first he view'd he did it with a serious mind a heed was in his countenance you he bade attend him here this morning is he ready to come abroad i think by this he is leave me awhile exit cromwell aside it shall be to the duchess of alencon the french king 's sister he shall marry her anne bullen no i 'll no anne bullens for him there 's more in't than fair visage bullen no we 'll no bullens speedily i wish to hear from rome the marchioness of pembroke he 's discontented may be he hears the king does whet his anger to him sharp enough lord for thy justice aside   the late queen 's gentlewoman a knight 's daughter to be her mistress mistress the queen 's queen this candle burns not clear tis i must snuff it then out it goes what though i know her virtuous and well deserving yet i know her for a spleeny lutheran and not wholesome to our cause that she should lie i the bosom of our hard ruled king again there is sprung up an heretic an arch one cranmer one hath crawl'd into the favour of the king and is his oracle he is vex'd at something i would twere something that would fret the string the master cord on 's heart enter king henry viii reading of a schedule and lovell the king the king what piles of wealth hath he accumulated to his own portion and what expense by the hour seems to flow from him how i the name of thrift does he rake this together now my lords saw you the cardinal my lord we have stood here observing him some strange commotion is in his brain he bites his lip and starts stops on a sudden looks upon the ground then lays his finger on his temple straight springs out into fast gait then stops again strikes his breast hard and anon he casts his eye against the moon in most strange postures we have seen him set himself it may well be there is a mutiny in 's mind this morning papers of state he sent me to peruse as i required and wot you what i found there,--on my conscience put unwittingly forsooth an inventory thus importing the several parcels of his plate his treasure rich stuffs and ornaments of household which i find at such proud rate that it out speaks possession of a subject it 's heaven 's will some spirit put this paper in the packet to bless your eye withal if we did think his contemplation were above the earth and fix'd on spiritual object he should still dwell in his musings but i am afraid his thinkings are below the moon not worth his serious considering king henry viii takes his seat whispers lovell who goes to cardinal wolsey heaven forgive me ever god bless your highness good my lord you are full of heavenly stuff and bear the inventory of your best graces in your mind the which you were now running o'er you have scarce time to steal from spiritual leisure a brief span to keep your earthly audit sure in that i deem you an ill husband and am glad to have you therein my companion sir for holy offices i have a time a time to think upon the part of business which i bear i the state and nature does require her times of preservation which perforce i her frail son amongst my brethren mortal must give my tendence to you have said well and ever may your highness yoke together as i will lend you cause my doing well with my well saying tis well said again and tis a kind of good deed to say well and yet words are no deeds my father loved you his said he did and with his deed did crown his word upon you since i had my office i have kept you next my heart have not alone employ'd you where high profits might come home but pared my present havings to bestow my bounties upon you aside              what should this mean aside   the lord increase this business have i not made you the prime man of the state i pray you tell me if what i now pronounce you have found true and if you may confess it say withal if you are bound to us or no what say you my sovereign i confess your royal graces shower'd on me daily have been more than could my studied purposes requite which went beyond all man 's endeavours my endeavours have ever come too short of my desires yet filed with my abilities mine own ends have been mine so that evermore they pointed to the good of your most sacred person and the profit of the state for your great graces heap'd upon me poor undeserver i can nothing render but allegiant thanks my prayers to heaven for you my loyalty which ever has and ever shall be growing till death that winter kill it fairly answer'd a loyal and obedient subject is therein illustrated the honour of it does pay the act of it as i the contrary the foulness is the punishment i presume that as my hand has open'd bounty to you my heart dropp'd love my power rain'd honour more on you than any so your hand and heart your brain and every function of your power should notwithstanding that your bond of duty as twere in love 's particular be more to me your friend than any i do profess that for your highness good i ever labour'd more than mine own that am have and will be-- though all the world should crack their duty to you and throw it from their soul though perils did abound as thick as thought could make 'em and appear in forms more horrid,--yet my duty as doth a rock against the chiding flood should the approach of this wild river break and stand unshaken yours tis nobly spoken take notice lords he has a loyal breast for you have seen him open't read o'er this giving him papers and after this and then to breakfast with what appetite you have exit king henry viii frowning upon cardinal wolsey the nobles throng after him smiling and whispering what should this mean what sudden anger 's this how have i reap'd it he parted frowning from me as if ruin leap'd from his eyes so looks the chafed lion upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him then makes him nothing i must read this paper i fear the story of his anger tis so this paper has undone me tis the account of all that world of wealth i have drawn together for mine own ends indeed to gain the popedom and fee my friends in rome o negligence fit for a fool to fall by what cross devil made me put this main secret in the packet i sent the king is there no way to cure this no new device to beat this from his brains i know twill stir him strongly yet i know a way if it take right in spite of fortune will bring me off again what 's this to the pope the letter as i live with all the business i writ to 's holiness nay then farewell i have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness and from that full meridian of my glory i haste now to my setting i shall fall like a bright exhalation m the evening and no man see me more re enter to cardinal wolsey norfolk and suffolk surrey and the chamberlain hear the king 's pleasure cardinal who commands you to render up the great seal presently into our hands and to confine yourself to asher house my lord of winchester 's till you hear further from his highness stay where 's your commission lords words can not carry authority so weighty who dare cross 'em bearing the king 's will from his mouth expressly till i find more than will or words to do it i mean your malice know officious lords i dare and must deny it now i feel of what coarse metal ye are moulded envy how eagerly ye follow my disgraces as if it fed ye and how sleek and wanton ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin follow your envious courses men of malice you have christian warrant for 'em and no doubt in time will find their fit rewards that seal you ask with such a violence the king mine and your master with his own hand gave me bade me enjoy it with the place and honours during my life and to confirm his goodness tied it by letters patents now who 'll take it the king that gave it it must be himself then thou art a proud traitor priest proud lord thou liest within these forty hours surrey durst better have burnt that tongue than said so thy ambition thou scarlet sin robb'd this bewailing land of noble buckingham my father in law the heads of all thy brother cardinals with thee and all thy best parts bound together weigh'd not a hair of his plague of your policy you sent me deputy for ireland far from his succor from the king from all that might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him whilst your great goodness out of holy pity absolved him with an axe this and all else this talking lord can lay upon my credit i answer is most false the duke by law found his deserts how innocent i was from any private malice in his end his noble jury and foul cause can witness if i loved many words lord i should tell you you have as little honesty as honour that in the way of loyalty and truth toward the king my ever royal master dare mate a sounder man than surrey can be and all that love his follies by my soul your long coat priest protects you thou shouldst feel my sword i the life blood of thee else my lords can ye endure to hear this arrogance and from this fellow if we live thus tamely to be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet farewell nobility let his grace go forward and dare us with his cap like larks all goodness is poison to thy stomach yes that goodness of gleaning all the land 's wealth into one into your own hands cardinal by extortion the goodness of your intercepted packets you writ to the pope against the king your goodness since you provoke me shall be most notorious my lord of norfolk as you are truly noble as you respect the common good the state of our despised nobility our issues who if he live will scarce be gentlemen produce the grand sum of his sins the articles collected from his life i 'll startle you worse than the scaring bell when the brown wench lay kissing in your arms lord cardinal how much methinks i could despise this man but that i am bound in charity against it those articles my lord are in the king 's hand but thus much they are foul ones so much fairer and spotless shall mine innocence arise when the king knows my truth this can not save you i thank my memory i yet remember some of these articles and out they shall now if you can blush and cry guilty cardinal you 'll show a little honesty speak on sir i dare your worst objections if i blush it is to see a nobleman want manners i had rather want those than my head have at you first that without the king 's assent or knowledge you wrought to be a legate by which power you maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops then that in all you writ to rome or else to foreign princes ego et rex meus was still inscribed in which you brought the king to be your servant then that without the knowledge either of king or council when you went ambassador to the emperor you made bold to carry into flanders the great seal item you sent a large commission to gregory de cassado to conclude without the king 's will or the state 's allowance a league between his highness and ferrara that out of mere ambition you have caused your holy hat to be stamp'd on the king 's coin then that you have sent innumerable substance-- by what means got i leave to your own conscience-- to furnish rome and to prepare the ways you have for dignities to the mere undoing of all the kingdom many more there are which since they are of you and odious i will not taint my mouth with o my lord press not a falling man too far tis virtue his faults lie open to the laws let them not you correct him my heart weeps to see him so little of his great self i forgive him lord cardinal the king 's further pleasure is because all those things you have done of late by your power legatine within this kingdom fall into the compass of a praemunire that therefore such a writ be sued against you to forfeit all your goods lands tenements chattels and whatsoever and to be out of the king 's protection this is my charge and so we 'll leave you to your meditations how to live better for your stubborn answer about the giving back the great seal to us the king shall know it and no doubt shall thank you so fare you well my little good lord cardinal exeunt all but cardinal wolsey so farewell to the little good you bear me farewell a long farewell to all my greatness this is the state of man to day he puts forth the tender leaves of hopes to morrow blossoms and bears his blushing honours thick upon him the third day comes a frost a killing frost and when he thinks good easy man full surely his greatness is a ripening nips his root and then he falls as i do i have ventured like little wanton boys that swim on bladders this many summers in a sea of glory but far beyond my depth my high blown pride at length broke under me and now has left me weary and old with service to the mercy of a rude stream that must for ever hide me vain pomp and glory of this world i hate ye i feel my heart new open'd o how wretched is that poor man that hangs on princes favours there is betwixt that smile we would aspire to that sweet aspect of princes and their ruin more pangs and fears than wars or women have and when he falls he falls like lucifer never to hope again enter cromwell and stands amazed why how now cromwell i have no power to speak sir what amazed at my misfortunes can thy spirit wonder a great man should decline nay an you weep i am fall'n indeed how does your grace why well never so truly happy my good cromwell i know myself now and i feel within me a peace above all earthly dignities a still and quiet conscience the king has cured me i humbly thank his grace and from these shoulders these ruin'd pillars out of pity taken a load would sink a navy too much honour o tis a burthen cromwell tis a burthen too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven i am glad your grace has made that right use of it i hope i have i am able now methinks out of a fortitude of soul i feel to endure more miseries and greater far than my weak hearted enemies dare offer what news abroad the heaviest and the worst is your displeasure with the king god bless him the next is that sir thomas more is chosen lord chancellor in your place that 's somewhat sudden but he 's a learned man may he continue long in his highness favour and do justice for truth 's sake and his conscience that his bones when he has run his course and sleeps in blessings may have a tomb of orphans tears wept on em what more that cranmer is return'd with welcome install'd lord archbishop of canterbury that 's news indeed last that the lady anne whom the king hath in secrecy long married this day was view'd in open as his queen going to chapel and the voice is now only about her coronation there was the weight that pull'd me down o cromwell the king has gone beyond me all my glories in that one woman i have lost for ever no sun shall ever usher forth mine honours or gild again the noble troops that waited upon my smiles go get thee from me cromwell i am a poor fall'n man unworthy now to be thy lord and master seek the king that sun i pray may never set i have told him what and how true thou art he will advance thee some little memory of me will stir him-- i know his noble nature not to let thy hopeful service perish too good cromwell neglect him not make use now and provide for thine own future safety o my lord must i then leave you must i needs forego so good so noble and so true a master bear witness all that have not hearts of iron with what a sorrow cromwell leaves his lord the king shall have my service but my prayers for ever and for ever shall be yours cromwell i did not think to shed a tear in all my miseries but thou hast forced me out of thy honest truth to play the woman let 's dry our eyes and thus far hear me cromwell and when i am forgotten as i shall be and sleep in dull cold marble where no mention of me more must be heard of say i taught thee say wolsey that once trod the ways of glory and sounded all the depths and shoals of honour found thee a way out of his wreck to rise in a sure and safe one though thy master miss'd it mark but my fall and that that ruin'd me cromwell i charge thee fling away ambition by that sin fell the angels how can man then the image of his maker hope to win by it love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee corruption wins not more than honesty still in thy right hand carry gentle peace to silence envious tongues be just and fear not let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country 's thy god 's and truth 's then if thou fall'st o cromwell thou fall'st a blessed martyr serve the king and,--prithee lead me in there take an inventory of all i have to the last penny tis the king 's my robe and my integrity to heaven is all i dare now call mine own o cromwell cromwell had i but served my god with half the zeal i served my king he would not in mine age have left me naked to mine enemies good sir have patience so i have farewell the hopes of court my hopes in heaven do dwell exeunt act iv scene i. a street in westminster enter two gentlemen meeting one another you 're well met once again so are you you come to take your stand here and behold the lady anne pass from her coronation tis all my business at our last encounter the duke of buckingham came from his trial tis very true but that time offer'd sorrow this general joy tis well the citizens i am sure have shown at full their royal minds-- as let 'em have their rights they are ever forward-- in celebration of this day with shows pageants and sights of honour never greater nor i 'll assure you better taken sir may i be bold to ask at what that contains that paper in your hand yes tis the list of those that claim their offices this day by custom of the coronation the duke of suffolk is the first and claims to be high steward next the duke of norfolk he to be earl marshal you may read the rest i thank you sir had i not known those customs i should have been beholding to your paper but i beseech you what 's become of katharine the princess dowager how goes her business that i can tell you too the archbishop of canterbury accompanied with other learned and reverend fathers of his order held a late court at dunstable six miles off from ampthill where the princess lay to which she was often cited by them but appear'd not and to be short for not appearance and the king 's late scruple by the main assent of all these learned men she was divorced and the late marriage made of none effect since which she was removed to kimbolton where she remains now sick alas good lady trumpets the trumpets sound stand close the queen is coming hautboys the order of the coronation 1 a lively flourish of trumpets 2 then two judges 3 lord chancellor with the purse and mace before him 4 choristers singing music 5 mayor of london bearing the mace then garter in his coat of arms and on his head a gilt copper crown 6 marquess dorset bearing a sceptre of gold on his head a demi coronal of gold with him surrey bearing the rod of silver with the dove crowned with an earl 's coronet collars of ss 7 suffolk in his robe of estate his coronet on his head bearing a long white wand as high steward with him norfolk with the rod of marshalship a coronet on his head collars of ss 8 a canopy borne by four of the cinque ports under it queen anne in her robe in her hair richly adorned with pearl crowned on each side her the bishops of london and winchester 9 the old duchess of norfolk in a coronal of gold wrought with flowers bearing queen anne 's train 10 certain ladies or countesses with plain circlets of gold without flowers they pass over the stage in order and state a royal train believe me these i know who 's that that bears the sceptre marquess dorset and that the earl of surrey with the rod a bold brave gentleman that should be the duke of suffolk tis the same high steward and that my lord of norfolk yes heaven bless thee looking on queen anne thou hast the sweetest face i ever look'd on sir as i have a soul she is an angel our king has all the indies in his arms and more and richer when he strains that lady i can not blame his conscience they that bear the cloth of honour over her are four barons of the cinque ports those men are happy and so are all are near her i take it she that carries up the train is that old noble lady duchess of norfolk it is and all the rest are countesses their coronets say so these are stars indeed and sometimes falling ones no more of that exit procession and then a great flourish of trumpets enter a third gentleman god save you sir where have you been broiling among the crowd i the abbey where a finger could not be wedged in more i am stifled with the mere rankness of their joy you saw the ceremony that i did how was it well worth the seeing good sir speak it to us as well as i am able the rich stream of lords and ladies having brought the queen to a prepared place in the choir fell off a distance from her while her grace sat down to rest awhile some half an hour or so in a rich chair of state opposing freely the beauty of her person to the people believe me sir she is the goodliest woman that ever lay by man which when the people had the full view of such a noise arose as the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest as loud and to as many tunes hats cloaks-- doublets i think,--flew up and had their faces been loose this day they had been lost such joy i never saw before great bellied women that had not half a week to go like rams in the old time of war would shake the press and make 'em reel before 'em no man living could say this is my wife there all were woven so strangely in one piece but what follow'd at length her grace rose and with modest paces came to the altar where she kneel'd and saint like cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly then rose again and bow'd her to the people when by the archbishop of canterbury she had all the royal makings of a queen as holy oil edward confessor 's crown the rod and bird of peace and all such emblems laid nobly on her which perform'd the choir with all the choicest music of the kingdom together sung te deum so she parted and with the same full state paced back again to york place where the feast is held sir you must no more call it york place that 's past for since the cardinal fell that title 's lost tis now the king 's and call'd whitehall i know it but tis so lately alter'd that the old name is fresh about me what two reverend bishops were those that went on each side of the queen stokesly and gardiner the one of winchester newly preferr'd from the king 's secretary the other london he of winchester is held no great good lover of the archbishop 's the virtuous cranmer all the land knows that however yet there is no great breach when it comes cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him who may that be i pray you thomas cromwell a man in much esteem with the king and truly a worthy friend the king has made him master o the jewel house and one already of the privy council he will deserve more yes without all doubt come gentlemen ye shall go my way which is to the court and there ye shall be my guests something i can command as i walk thither i 'll tell ye more you may command us sir exeunt scene ii kimbolton enter katharine dowager sick led between griffith her gentleman usher and patience her woman how does your grace o griffith sick to death my legs like loaden branches bow to the earth willing to leave their burthen reach a chair so now methinks i feel a little ease didst thou not tell me griffith as thou led'st me that the great child of honour cardinal wolsey was dead yes madam but i think your grace out of the pain you suffer'd gave no ear to't prithee good griffith tell me how he died if well he stepp'd before me happily for my example well the voice goes madam for after the stout earl northumberland arrested him at york and brought him forward as a man sorely tainted to his answer he fell sick suddenly and grew so ill he could not sit his mule alas poor man at last with easy roads he came to leicester lodged in the abbey where the reverend abbot with all his covent honourably received him to whom he gave these words o father abbot an old man broken with the storms of state is come to lay his weary bones among ye give him a little earth for charity so went to bed where eagerly his sickness pursued him still and three nights after this about the hour of eight which he himself foretold should be his last full of repentance continual meditations tears and sorrows he gave his honours to the world again his blessed part to heaven and slept in peace so may he rest his faults lie gently on him yet thus far griffith give me leave to speak him and yet with charity he was a man of an unbounded stomach ever ranking himself with princes one that by suggestion tied all the kingdom simony was fair play his own opinion was his law i the presence he would say untruths and be ever double both in his words and meaning he was never but where he meant to ruin pitiful his promises were as he then was mighty but his performance as he is now nothing of his own body he was ill and gave the clergy in example noble madam men 's evil manners live in brass their virtues we write in water may it please your highness to hear me speak his good now yes good griffith i were malicious else this cardinal though from an humble stock undoubtedly was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle he was a scholar and a ripe and good one exceeding wise fair spoken and persuading lofty and sour to them that loved him not but to those men that sought him sweet as summer and though he were unsatisfied in getting which was a sin yet in bestowing madam he was most princely ever witness for him those twins of learning that he raised in you ipswich and oxford one of which fell with him unwilling to outlive the good that did it the other though unfinish'd yet so famous so excellent in art and still so rising that christendom shall ever speak his virtue his overthrow heap'd happiness upon him for then and not till then he felt himself and found the blessedness of being little and to add greater honours to his age than man could give him he died fearing god after my death i wish no other herald no other speaker of my living actions to keep mine honour from corruption but such an honest chronicler as griffith whom i most hated living thou hast made me with thy religious truth and modesty now in his ashes honour peace be with him patience be near me still and set me lower i have not long to trouble thee good griffith cause the musicians play me that sad note i named my knell whilst i sit meditating on that celestial harmony i go to sad and solemn music she is asleep good wench let 's sit down quiet for fear we wake her softly gentle patience the vision enter solemnly tripping one after   another six personages clad in white robes   wearing on their heads garlands of bays and golden   vizards on their faces branches of bays or palm in   their hands they first congee unto her then   dance and at certain changes the first two hold   a spare garland over her head at which the other   four make reverent curtsies then the two that held   the garland deliver the same to the other next two   who observe the same order in their changes and   holding the garland over her head which done   they deliver the same garland to the last two who   likewise observe the same order at which as it   were by inspiration she makes in her sleep signs   of rejoicing and holdeth up her hands to heaven   and so in their dancing vanish carrying the garland with them the music continues spirits of peace where are ye are ye all gone and leave me here in wretchedness behind ye madam we are here it is not you i call for saw ye none enter since i slept none madam no saw you not even now a blessed troop invite me to a banquet whose bright faces cast thousand beams upon me like

stand empty but we all are men in our own natures frail and capable of our flesh few are angels out of which frailty and want of wisdom you that best should teach us have misdemean'd yourself and not a little toward the king first then his laws in filling the whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains for so we are inform'd with new opinions divers and dangerous which are heresies and not reform'd may prove pernicious which reformation must be sudden too my noble lords for those that tame wild horses pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle but stop their mouths with stubborn bits and spur 'em till they obey the manage if we suffer out of our easiness and childish pity to one man 's honour this contagious sickness farewell all physic and what follows then commotions

of my life and office i have labour'd and with no little study that my teaching and the strong course of my authority might go one way and safely and the end was ever to do well nor is there living i speak it with a single heart my lords a man that more detests more stirs against both in his private conscience and his place defacers of a public peace than i do pray heaven the king may never find a heart with less allegiance in it men that make envy and crooked malice nourishment dare bite the best i do beseech your lordships that in this case of justice my accusers be what they will may stand forth face to face and freely urge against me nay my lord that can not be you are a counsellor and by that virtue no man dare accuse you my lord because we have business of more moment we will be short with you tis his highness pleasure and our consent for better trial of you from hence you be committed to the tower where being but a private man again you shall know many dare accuse you boldly

your painted gloss discovers to men that understand you words and weakness my lord of winchester you are a little by your good favour too sharp men so noble however faulty yet should find respect for what they have been tis a cruelty to load a falling man good master secretary i cry your honour mercy you may worst of all this table say so why my lord do not i know you for a favourer of this new sect ye are not sound not sound not sound i say would you were half so honest men 's prayers then would seek you not their fears i shall remember this bold language do remember your bold life too this

wise but most religious one that in all obedience makes the church the chief aim of his honour and to strengthen that holy duty out of dear respect his royal self in judgment comes to hear the cause betwixt her and this great offender you were ever good at sudden commendations bishop of winchester but know i come not to hear such flattery now and in my presence they are too thin and bare to hide offences to me you can not reach you play the spaniel and think with wagging of your tongue to win me but whatsoe'er thou takest me for i 'm sure thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody to cranmer good man sit down now let me see the proudest he that dares most but wag his finger at thee by all that 's holy he had better starve than but once think this place becomes thee not may it please your

deserve that title,-- this honest man wait like a lousy footboy at chamber door and one as great as you are why what a shame was this did my commission bid ye so far forget yourselves i gave ye power as he was a counsellor to try him not as a groom there 's some of ye i see more out of malice than integrity would try him to the utmost had ye mean which ye shall never have while i live thus far my most dread sovereign may it like your grace to let my tongue excuse all what was purposed concerning his imprisonment was rather if there be faith in men meant for his trial and fair purgation to the world than malice i 'm sure in me well well my lords respect him take him and use him well he 's worthy of it i will say thus much for him if a prince may be beholding to a subject i am for his love

honour exeunt scene ii a street enter lucio and two gentlemen if the duke with the other dukes come not to composition with the king of hungary why then all the dukes fall upon the king heaven grant us its peace but not the king of hungary 's amen thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate that went to sea with the ten commandments but scraped one out of the table thou shalt not steal ay that he razed why twas a commandment to command the captain and all the rest from their functions they put forth to steal there 's not a soldier of us all that in the thanksgiving before meat do relish the petition well that prays for peace i never heard any soldier dislike it i believe thee for i think thou never wast where grace was said no a dozen times at least what in metre in any proportion or in any language i think or in any religion ay why not grace is grace despite of all controversy as for example thou thyself art a wicked villain despite of all grace well there went but a pair of shears between us i grant as there may between the lists and the velvet thou art the list and thou the velvet thou art good velvet thou'rt a three piled piece i warrant thee i had as lief be a list of an english kersey as be piled as thou art piled for a french velvet do i speak feelingly now i think thou dost and indeed with most painful feeling of thy speech i will out of thine own confession learn to begin thy health but whilst i live forget to drink after thee i think i have done myself wrong have i not yes that thou hast whether thou art tainted or free behold behold where madam mitigation comes i have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to-- to what i pray judge to three thousand dolours a year ay and more a french crown more thou art always figuring diseases in me but thou art full of error i am sound nay not as one would say healthy but so sound as things that are hollow thy bones are hollow impiety has made a feast of thee enter mistress overdone how now which of your hips has the most profound sciatica well well there 's one yonder arrested and carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all who 's that i pray thee marry sir that 's claudio signior claudio claudio to prison tis not so nay but i know tis so i saw him arrested saw him carried away and which is more within these three days his head to be chopped off but after all this fooling i would not have it so art thou sure of this i am too sure of it and it is for getting madam julietta with child believe me this may be he promised to meet me two hours since and he was ever precise in promise keeping besides you know it draws something near to the speech we had to such a purpose but most of all agreeing with the proclamation away let 's go learn the truth of it exeunt lucio and gentlemen thus what with the war what with the sweat what with the gallows and what with poverty i am custom shrunk enter pompey how now what 's the news with you yonder man is carried to prison well what has he done a woman but what 's his offence groping for trouts in a peculiar river what is there a maid with child by him no but there 's a woman with maid by him you have not heard of the proclamation have you what proclamation man all houses in the suburbs of vienna must be plucked down and what shall become of those in the city they shall stand for seed they had gone down too but that a wise burgher put in for them but shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pulled down to the ground mistress why here 's a change indeed in the commonwealth what shall become of me come fear you not good counsellors lack no clients though you change your place you need not change your trade i 'll be your tapster still courage there will be pity taken on you you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service you will be considered what 's to do here thomas tapster let 's withdraw here comes signior claudio led by the provost to prison and there 's madam juliet exeunt enter provost claudio juliet and officers fellow why dost thou show me thus to the world bear me to prison where i am committed i do it not in evil disposition but from lord angelo by special charge thus can the demigod authority make us pay down for our offence by weight the words of heaven on whom it will it will on whom it will not so yet still tis just re enter lucio and two gentlemen why how now claudio whence comes this restraint from too much liberty my lucio liberty as surfeit is the father of much fast so every scope by the immoderate use turns to restraint our natures do pursue like rats that ravin down their proper bane a thirsty evil and when we drink we die if could speak so wisely under an arrest i would send for certain of my creditors and yet to say the truth i had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment what 's thy offence claudio what but to speak of would offend again what is't murder no lechery call it so away sir you must go one word good friend lucio a word with you a hundred if they 'll do you any good is lechery so look'd after thus stands it with me upon a true contract i got possession of julietta 's bed you know the lady she is fast my wife save that we do the denunciation lack of outward order this we came not to only for propagation of a dower remaining in the coffer of her friends from whom we thought it meet to hide our love till time had made them for us but it chances the stealth of our most mutual entertainment with character too gross is writ on juliet with child perhaps unhappily even so and the new deputy now for the duke-- whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness or whether that the body public be a horse whereon the governor doth ride who newly in the seat that it may know he can command lets it straight feel the spur whether the tyranny be in his place or in his emmence that fills it up i stagger in:--but this new governor awakes me all the enrolled penalties which have like unscour'd armour hung by the wall so long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round and none of them been worn and for a name now puts the drowsy and neglected act freshly on me tis surely for a name i warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love may sigh it off send after the duke and appeal to him i have done so but he 's not to be found i prithee lucio do me this kind service this day my sister should the cloister enter and there receive her approbation acquaint her with the danger of my state implore her in my voice that she make friends to the strict deputy bid herself assay him i have great hope in that for in her youth there is a prone and speechless dialect such as move men beside she hath prosperous art when she will play with reason and discourse and well she can persuade i pray she may as well for the encouragement of the like which else would stand under grievous imposition as for the enjoying of thy life who i would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of tick tack i 'll to her i thank you good friend lucio within two hours come officer away exeunt scene iii a monastery enter duke vincentio and friar thomas no holy father throw away that thought believe not that the dribbling dart of love can pierce a complete bosom why i desire thee to give me secret harbour hath a purpose more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends of burning youth may your grace speak of it my holy sir none better knows than you how i have ever loved the life removed and held in idle price to haunt assemblies where youth and cost and witless bravery keeps i have deliver'd to lord angelo a man of stricture and firm abstinence my absolute power and place here in vienna and he supposes me travell'd to poland for so i have strew'd it in the common ear and so it is received now pious sir you will demand of me why i do this gladly my lord we have strict statutes and most biting laws the needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds which for this nineteen years we have let slip even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave that goes not out to prey now as fond fathers having bound up the threatening twigs of birch only to stick it in their children 's sight for terror not to use in time the rod becomes more mock'd than fear'd so our decrees dead to infliction to themselves are dead and liberty plucks justice by the nose the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart goes all decorum it rested in your grace to unloose this tied up justice when you pleased and it in you more dreadful would have seem'd than in lord angelo i do fear too dreadful sith twas my fault to give the people scope twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them for what i bid them do for we bid this be done when evil deeds have their permissive pass and not the punishment therefore indeed my father i have on angelo imposed the office who may in the ambush of my name strike home and yet my nature never in the fight to do in slander and to behold his sway i will as twere a brother of your order visit both prince and people therefore i prithee supply me with the habit and instruct me how i may formally in person bear me like a true friar more reasons for this action at our more leisure shall i render you only this one lord angelo is precise stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses that his blood flows or that his appetite is more to bread than stone hence shall we see if power change purpose what our seemers be exeunt scene iv a nunnery enter isabella and francisca and have you nuns no farther privileges are not these large enough yes truly i speak not as desiring more but rather wishing a more strict restraint upon the sisterhood the votarists of saint clare within   ho peace be in this place who 's that which calls it is a man 's voice gentle isabella turn you the key and know his business of him you may i may not you are yet unsworn when you have vow'd you must not speak with men but in the presence of the prioress then if you speak you must not show your face or if you show your face you must not speak he calls again i pray you answer him exit peace and prosperity who is't that calls enter lucio hail virgin if you be as those cheek roses proclaim you are no less can you so stead me as bring me to the sight of isabella a novice of this place and the fair sister to her unhappy brother claudio why her unhappy brother let me ask the rather for i now must make you know i am that isabella and his sister gentle and fair your brother kindly greets you not to be weary with you he 's in prison woe me for what for that which if myself might be his judge he should receive his punishment in thanks he hath got his friend with child sir make me not your story it is true i would not though tis my familiar sin with maids to seem the lapwing and to jest tongue far from heart play with all virgins so i hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted by your renouncement an immortal spirit and to be talk'd with in sincerity as with a saint you do blaspheme the good in mocking me do not believe it fewness and truth tis thus your brother and his lover have embraced as those that feed grow full as blossoming time that from the seedness the bare fallow brings to teeming foison even so her plenteous womb expresseth his full tilth and husbandry some one with child by him my cousin juliet is she your cousin adoptedly as school maids change their names by vain though apt affection she it is o let him marry her this is the point the duke is very strangely gone from hence bore many gentlemen myself being one in hand and hope of action but we do learn by those that know the very nerves of state his givings out were of an infinite distance from his true meant design upon his place and with full line of his authority governs lord angelo a man whose blood is very snow broth one who never feels the wanton stings and motions of the sense but doth rebate and blunt his natural edge with profits of the mind study and fast he to give fear to use and liberty which have for long run by the hideous law as mice by lions hath pick'd out an act under whose heavy sense your brother 's life falls into forfeit he arrests him on it and follows close the rigour of the statute to make him an example all hope is gone unless you have the grace by your fair prayer to soften angelo and that 's my pith of business twixt you and your poor brother doth he so seek his life has censured him already and as i hear the provost hath a warrant for his execution alas what poor ability 's in me to do him good assay the power you have my power alas i doubt-- our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt go to lord angelo and let him learn to know when maidens sue men give like gods but when they weep and kneel all their petitions are as freely theirs as they themselves would owe them i 'll see what i can do but speedily i will about it straight no longer staying but to give the mother notice of my affair i humbly thank you commend me to my brother soon at night i 'll send him certain word of my success i take my leave of you good sir adieu exeunt act ii scene i. a hall in angelo 's house

honour know whom i believe to be most strait in virtue that in the working of your own affections had time cohered with place or place with wishing or that the resolute acting of your blood could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose whether you had not sometime in your life err'd in this point which now you censure him and pull'd the law upon you tis one thing to be tempted escalus another thing to fall i not deny the jury passing on the prisoner 's life may in the sworn twelve have a thief or two guiltier than him they try what 's open made to justice that justice seizes what know the laws that thieves do pass on thieves tis very pregnant the jewel that we find we stoop and take't because we see it but what we do not see we tread upon and never think of it you may not so extenuate his offence for i have had such faults but rather tell me when i that censure him do so offend let mine own judgment pattern out my death and nothing come in partial sir he must die be it as your wisdom will where is the provost here if it like your honour see that claudio be executed by nine to morrow morning bring him his confessor let him be prepared for that 's the utmost of his pilgrimage

him he 's sentenced tis too late aside to isabella   you are too cold too late why no i that do speak a word may call it back again well believe this no ceremony that to great ones longs not the king 's crown nor the deputed sword the marshal 's truncheon nor the judge 's robe become them with one half so good a grace as mercy does if he had been as you and you as he you would have slipt like him but he like you would not have been so stern pray you be gone i would to heaven i had your potency and you were isabel should it then be thus no i would tell what twere to be a judge and what a prisoner aside to isabella ay touch him there 's the vein your brother is a forfeit of the law and you but waste your words alas alas why all the souls that were were forfeit once and he that might the vantage best have took found out the remedy how would you be if he which is the top of judgment should but judge you as you are o think on that and mercy then will breathe within your lips like man new made be you content fair maid it is the law not i condemn your brother were he my kinsman brother or my son it should be thus with him he must die tomorrow to morrow o that 's sudden spare him spare him he 's not prepared for death even for our kitchens we kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven with less respect than we do minister to our gross selves good good my lord bethink you who is it that hath died for this offence there 's many have committed it aside to isabella            ay well said the law hath not been dead though it hath slept those many had not dared to do that evil if the first that did the edict infringe had answer'd for his deed now tis awake takes note of what is done and like a prophet looks in a glass that shows what future evils either new or by remissness new conceived and so in progress to be hatch'd and born are now to have no successive degrees but ere they live to end yet show some pity i show it most of all when i show justice for then i pity those i do not know which a dismiss'd offence would after gall and do him right that answering one foul wrong lives not to act another be satisfied your brother dies to morrow be content so you must be the first that gives this sentence and he that suffer 's o it is excellent to have a giant 's strength but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant aside to isabella    that 's well said could great men thunder as jove himself does jove would ne'er be quiet for every pelting petty officer would use his heaven for thunder nothing but thunder merciful heaven thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak than the soft myrtle but man proud man drest in a little brief authority most ignorant of what he 's most assured his glassy essence like an angry ape plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven as make the angels weep who with our spleens would all themselves laugh mortal aside to isabella   o to him to him wench he will relent he 's coming i perceive t. aside   pray heaven she win him we can not weigh our brother with ourself great men may jest with saints tis wit in them but in the less foul profanation thou'rt i the right girl more o that that in the captain 's but a choleric word which in the soldier is flat blasphemy aside to isabella   art avised o that more on t. why do you put these sayings upon me because authority though it err like others hath yet a kind of medicine in itself that skins the vice o the top go to your bosom knock there and ask your heart what it doth know that 's like my brother 's fault if it confess a natural guiltiness such as is his let it not sound a thought upon your tongue against my brother 's life aside                   she speaks and tis such sense that my sense breeds with it fare you well gentle my lord turn back i will bethink me come again tomorrow hark how i 'll bribe you good my lord turn back how bribe me ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you aside to isabella   you had marr'd all else not with fond shekels of the tested gold or stones whose rates are either rich or poor as fancy values them but with true prayers that shall be up at heaven and enter there ere sun rise prayers from preserved souls from fasting maids whose minds are dedicate to nothing temporal well come to me to morrow aside to isabella   go to tis well away heaven keep your honour safe aside \t amen for i am that way going to temptation where prayers cross at what hour to morrow shall i attend your lordship at any time fore noon save your honour exeunt isabella lucio and provost from thee even from thy virtue what 's this what 's this is this her fault or mine the tempter or the tempted who sins most ha not she nor doth she tempt but it is i that lying by the violet in the sun do as the carrion does not as the flower corrupt with virtuous season can it be that modesty may more betray our sense than woman 's lightness having waste ground enough shall we desire to raze the sanctuary and pitch our evils there o fie fie fie what dost thou or what art thou angelo dost thou desire her foully for those things that make her good o let her brother live thieves for their robbery have authority when judges steal themselves what do i love her that i desire to hear her speak again and feast upon her eyes what is't i dream on o cunning enemy that to catch a saint with saints dost bait thy hook most dangerous is that temptation that doth goad us on to sin in loving virtue never could the strumpet with all her double vigour art and nature once stir my temper but this virtuous maid subdues me quite even till now when men were fond i smiled and wonder'd how exit scene iii a room in a prison enter severally duke vincentio disguised as a friar and provost hail to

mine who falling in the flaws of her own youth hath blister'd her report she is with child and he that got it sentenced a young man more fit to do another such offence than die for this when must he die as i do think to morrow i have provided for you stay awhile to juliet and you shall be conducted repent you fair one of the sin you carry i do and bear the shame most patiently i 'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience and try your penitence if it be sound or hollowly put on i 'll gladly learn love you the man that wrong'd you yes as i love the woman that wrong'd him so then it seems your most offenceful act was mutually committed mutually then was your sin of heavier kind than his i do confess it and repent it father tis meet so daughter but lest you do repent as that the sin hath brought you to this shame which sorrow is always towards ourselves not heaven showing we would not spare heaven as we love it but as we stand in fear,-- i do repent me as it is an evil and take the shame with joy there rest your partner as i hear must die to morrow and i am going with instruction to him grace go with you benedicite exit must die to morrow o injurious love that respites me a life whose very comfort is still a dying horror tis pity of him exeunt scene iv a room in angelo 's house enter angelo when i would pray and think i think and pray to several subjects heaven hath my empty words whilst my invention hearing not my tongue anchors on isabel heaven in my mouth as if i did but only chew his name and in my heart the strong and swelling evil of my conception the state whereon i studied is like a good thing being often read grown fear'd and tedious yea my gravity wherein let no man hear me i take pride could i with boot change for an idle plume which the air beats for vain o place o form how often dost thou with thy case thy habit wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls to thy false seeming blood thou art blood let 's write good angel on the devil 's horn tis not the devil 's crest enter a servant how now who 's there one isabel a sister desires access to you teach her the way exit servant o heavens why does my blood thus muster to my heart making both it unable for itself and dispossessing all my other parts of necessary fitness so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons come all to help him and so stop the air by which he should revive and even so the general subject to a well wish'd king quit their own part and in obsequious fondness crowd to his presence where their untaught love must needs appear offence enter isabella how now fair maid i am come to know your pleasure that you might know it would much better please me than to demand what tis your brother can not live even so heaven keep your honour yet may he live awhile and it may be as long as you or i yet he must die under your sentence yea when i beseech you that in his reprieve longer or shorter he may be so fitted that his soul sicken not ha fie these filthy vices it were as good to pardon him that hath from nature stolen a man already made as to remit their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven 's image in stamps that are forbid tis all as easy falsely to take away a life true made as to put metal in restrained means to make a false one tis set down so in heaven but not in earth say you so then i shall pose you quickly which had you rather that the most just law now took your brother 's life or to redeem him give up your body to such sweet uncleanness as she that he hath stain'd sir believe this i had rather give my body than my soul i talk not of your soul our compell'd sins stand more for number than for accompt how say you nay i 'll not warrant that for i can speak against the thing i say answer to this i now the voice of the recorded law pronounce a sentence on your brother 's life might there not be a charity in sin to save this brother 's life please you to do't i 'll take it as a peril to my soul it is no sin at all but charity pleased you to do't at peril of your soul were equal poise of sin and charity that i do beg his life if it be sin heaven let me bear it you granting of my suit if that be sin i 'll make it my morn prayer to have it added to the faults of mine and nothing of your answer nay but hear me your sense pursues not mine either you are ignorant or seem so craftily and that 's not good let me be ignorant and in nothing good but graciously to know i am no better thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright when it doth tax itself as these black masks proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder than beauty could display'd but mark me to be received plain i 'll speak more gross your brother is to die so and his offence is so as it appears accountant to the law upon that pain true admit no other way to save his life,-- as i subscribe not that nor any other but in the loss of question,--that you his sister finding yourself desired of such a person whose credit with the judge or own great place could fetch your brother from the manacles of the all building law and that there were no earthly mean to save him but that either you must lay down the treasures of your body to this supposed or else to let him suffer what would you do as much for my poor brother as myself that is were i under the terms of death the impression of keen whips i'ld wear as rubies and strip myself to death as to a bed that longing have been sick for ere i'ld yield my body up to shame then must your brother die and twere the cheaper way better it were a brother died at once than that a sister by redeeming him should die for ever were not you then as cruel as the sentence that you have slander'd so ignomy in ransom and free pardon are of two houses lawful mercy is nothing kin to foul redemption you seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant and rather proved the sliding of your brother a merriment than a vice o pardon me my lord it oft falls out to have what we would have we speak not what we mean i something do excuse the thing i hate for his advantage that i dearly love we are all frail else let my brother die if not a feodary but only he owe and succeed thy weakness nay women are frail too ay as the glasses where they view themselves which are as easy broke as they make forms women help heaven men their creation mar in profiting by them nay call us ten times frail for we are soft as our complexions are and credulous to false prints i think it well and from this testimony of your own sex,-- since i suppose we are made to be no stronger than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold i do arrest your words be that you are that is a woman if you be more you 're none if you be one as you are well express'd by all external warrants show it now by putting on the destined livery i have no tongue but one gentle my lord let me entreat you speak the former language plainly conceive i love you my brother did love juliet and you tell me that he shall die for it he shall not isabel if you give me love i know your virtue hath a licence in't which seems a little fouler than it is to pluck on others believe me on mine honour my words express my purpose ha little honour to be much believed and most pernicious purpose seeming seeming i will proclaim thee angelo look for't sign me a present pardon for my brother or with an outstretch'd throat i 'll tell the world aloud what man thou art who will believe thee isabel my unsoil'd name the austereness of my life my vouch against you and my place i the state will so your accusation overweigh that you shall stifle in your own report and smell of calumny i have begun and now i give my sensual race the rein fit thy consent to my sharp appetite lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes that banish what they sue for redeem thy brother by yielding up thy body to my will or else he must not only die the death but thy unkindness shall his death draw out to lingering sufferance answer me to morrow or by the affection that now guides me most i 'll prove a tyrant to him as for you say what you can my false o'erweighs your true exit to whom should i complain did i tell this who would believe me o perilous mouths that bear in them one and the self same tongue either of condemnation or approof bidding the law make court'sy to their will hooking both right and wrong to the appetite to follow as it draws i 'll to my brother though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood yet hath he in him such a mind of honour that had he twenty heads to tender down on twenty bloody blocks he'ld yield them up before his sister should her body stoop to such abhorr'd pollution then isabel live chaste and brother die more than our brother is our chastity i 'll tell him yet of angelo 's request and fit his mind to death for his soul 's rest exit act iii scene i. a room in the prison enter duke vincentio disguised as before claudio and provost so then you hope of pardon from lord angelo the miserable have no other medicine but only hope i 've hope to live and am prepared to die be absolute for death either death or life shall thereby be the sweeter reason thus with life if i do lose thee i do lose a thing that none but fools would keep a breath thou art servile to all the skyey influences that dost this habitation where thou keep'st hourly afflict merely thou art death 's fool for him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun and yet runn'st toward him still thou art not noble for all the accommodations that thou bear'st are nursed by baseness thou'rt by no means valiant for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork of a poor worm thy best of rest is sleep and that thou oft provokest yet grossly fear'st thy death which is no more thou art not thyself for thou exist'st on many a thousand grains that issue out of dust happy thou art not for what thou hast not still thou strivest to get and what thou hast forget'st thou art not certain for thy complexion shifts to strange effects after the moon if thou art rich thou'rt poor for like an ass whose back with ingots bows thou bear 's thy heavy riches but a journey and death unloads thee friend hast thou none for thine own bowels which do call thee sire the mere effusion of thy proper loins do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum for ending thee no sooner thou hast nor youth nor age but as it were an after dinner 's sleep dreaming on both for all thy blessed youth becomes as aged and doth beg the alms of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty to make thy riches pleasant what 's yet in this that bears the name of life yet in this life lie hid moe thousand deaths yet death we fear that makes these odds all even i humbly thank you to sue to live i find i seek to die and seeking death find life let it come on within   what ho peace here grace and good company who 's there come in the wish deserves a welcome dear sir ere long i 'll visit you again most holy sir i thank you enter isabella my business is a word or two with claudio and very welcome look signior here 's your sister provost a word with you as many as you please bring me to hear them speak where i may be concealed exeunt duke vincentio and provost now sister what 's the comfort why as all comforts are most good most good indeed lord angelo having affairs to heaven intends you for his swift ambassador where you shall be an everlasting leiger therefore your best appointment make with speed to morrow you set on is there no remedy none but such remedy as to save a head to cleave a heart in twain but is there any yes brother you may live there is a devilish mercy in the judge if you 'll implore it that will free your life but fetter you till death perpetual durance ay just perpetual durance a restraint though all the world 's vastidity you had to a determined scope but in what nature in such a one as you consenting to't would bark your honour from that trunk you bear and leave you naked let me know the point o i do fear thee claudio and i quake lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain and six or seven winters more respect than a perpetual honour darest thou die the sense of death is most in apprehension and the poor beetle that we tread upon in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great as when a giant dies why give you me this shame think you i can a resolution fetch from flowery tenderness if i must die i will encounter darkness as a bride and hug it in mine arms there spake my brother there my father 's grave did utter forth a voice yes thou must die thou art too noble to conserve a life in base appliances this outward sainted deputy whose settled visage and deliberate word nips youth i the head and follies doth emmew as falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil his filth within being cast he would appear a pond as deep as hell the prenzie angelo o tis the cunning livery of hell the damned'st body to invest and cover in prenzie guards dost thou think claudio if i would yield him my virginity thou mightst be freed o heavens it can not be yes he would give't thee from this rank offence so to offend him still this night 's the time that i should do what i abhor to name or else thou diest to morrow thou shalt not do't o were it but my life i'ld throw it down for your deliverance as frankly as a pin thanks dear isabel be ready claudio for your death tomorrow yes has he affections in him that thus can make him bite the law by the nose when he would force it sure it is no sin or of the deadly seven it is the least which is the least if it were damnable he being so wise why would he for the momentary trick be perdurably fined o isabel what says my brother death is a fearful thing and shamed life a hateful ay but to die and go we know not where to lie in cold obstruction and to rot this sensible warm motion to become a kneaded clod and the delighted spirit to bathe in fiery floods or to reside in thrilling region of thick ribbed ice to be imprison'd in the viewless winds and blown with restless violence round about the pendent world or to be worse than worst of those that lawless and incertain thought imagine howling tis too horrible the weariest and most loathed worldly life that age ache penury and imprisonment can lay on nature is a paradise to what we fear of death alas alas sweet sister let me live what sin you do to save a brother 's life nature dispenses with the deed so far that it becomes a virtue o you beast o faithless coward o dishonest wretch wilt thou be made a man out of my vice is't not a kind of incest to take life from thine own sister 's shame what should i think heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair for such a warped slip of wilderness ne'er issued from his blood take my defiance die perish might but my bending down reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed i 'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death no word to save thee nay hear me isabel o fie fie fie thy sin 's not accidental but a trade mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd tis best thou diest quickly o hear me isabella re enter duke vincentio vouchsafe a word young sister but one word what is your will might you dispense with your leisure i would by and by have some speech with you the satisfaction i would require is likewise your own benefit i have no superfluous leisure my stay must be stolen out of other affairs but i will attend you awhile walks apart son i have overheard what hath passed between you and your sister angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her only he hath made an essay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition of natures she having the truth of honour in her hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive i am confessor to angelo and i know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to death do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible tomorrow you must die go to your knees and make ready let me ask my sister pardon i am so out of love with life that i will sue to be rid of it hold you there farewell exit claudio provost a word with you re enter provost what 's your will father that now you are come you will be gone leave me awhile with the maid my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company in good time exit provost isabella comes forward the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness but grace being the soul of your complexion shall keep the body of it ever fair the assault that angelo hath made to you fortune hath conveyed to my understanding and but that frailty hath examples for his falling i should wonder at angelo how will you do to content this substitute and to save your brother i am now going to resolve him i had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born but o how much is the good duke deceived in angelo if ever he return and i can speak to him i will open my lips in vain or discover his government that shall not be much amiss yet as the matter now stands he will avoid your accusation he made trial of you only therefore fasten your ear on my advisings to the love i have in doing good a remedy presents itself i do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to your own gracious person and much please the absent duke if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business let me hear you speak farther i have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit virtue is bold and goodness never fearful have you not heard speak of mariana the sister of frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea i have heard of the lady and good words went with her name she should this angelo have married was affianced to her by oath and the nuptial appointed between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity her brother frederick was wrecked at sea having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister but mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman there she lost a noble and renowned brother in his love toward her ever most kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of her fortune her marriage dowry with both her combinate husband this well seeming angelo can this be so did angelo so leave her left her in her tears and dried not one of them with his comfort swallowed his vows whole pretending in her discoveries of dishonour in few bestowed her on her own lamentation which she yet wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears is washed with them but relents not what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world what corruption in this life that it will let this man live but how out of this can she avail it is a rupture that you may easily heal and the cure of it not only saves your brother but keeps you from dishonour in doing it show me how good father this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection his unjust unkindness that in all reason should have quenched her love hath like an impediment in the current made it more violent and unruly go you to angelo answer his requiring with a plausible obedience agree with his demands to the point only refer yourself to this advantage first that your stay with him may not be long that the time may have all shadow and silence in it and the place answer to convenience this being granted in course,--and now follows all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment go in your place if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter it may compel him to her recompense and here by this is your brother saved your honour untainted the poor mariana advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled the maid will i frame and make fit for his attempt if you think well to carry this as you may the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof what think you of it the image of it gives me content already and i trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection it lies much in your holding up haste you speedily to angelo if for this night he entreat you to his bed give him promise of satisfaction i will presently to saint luke 's there at the moated grange resides this dejected mariana at that place call upon me and dispatch with angelo that it may be quickly i thank you for this

come go to kennel pompey go exeunt elbow pompey and officers what news friar of the duke i know none can you tell me of any some say he is with the emperor of russia other some he is in rome but where is he think you i know not where but wheresoever i wish him well it was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state and usurp the beggary he was never born to lord angelo dukes it well in his absence he puts transgression to t. he does well in t. a little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him something too crabbed that way friar it is too general a vice and severity must cure it yes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred it is well allied but it is impossible to extirp it quite friar till eating and drinking be put down they say this angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation is it true think you how should he be made then some report a sea maid spawned him some that he was begot between two stock fishes but it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congealed ice that i know to be true and he is a motion generative that 's infallible you are pleasant sir and speak apace why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man would the duke that is absent have done this ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing a thousand he had some feeling of the sport he knew the service and that instructed him to mercy i never heard the absent duke much detected for women he was not inclined that way o sir you are deceived tis not possible who not the duke yes your beggar of fifty and his use was to put a ducat in her clack dish the duke had crotchets in him he would be drunk too that let me inform you you do him wrong surely sir i was an inward of his a shy fellow was the duke and i believe i know the cause of his withdrawing what i prithee might be the cause no pardon tis a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips but this i can let you understand the greater file of the subject held the duke to be wise wise why no question but he was a very superficial ignorant unweighing fellow either this is the envy in you folly or mistaking the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation let him be but testimonied in his own bringings forth and he shall appear to the envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier therefore you speak unskilfully or if your knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice sir i know him and i love him love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with dearer love come sir i know what i know i can hardly believe that since you know not what you speak but if ever the duke return as our prayers are he may let me desire you to make your answer before him if it be honest you have spoke you have courage to maintain it i am bound to call upon you and i pray you your name sir my name is lucio well known to the duke he shall know you better sir if i may live to report you i fear you not o you hope the duke will return no more or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite but indeed i can do you little harm you 'll forswear this again i 'll be hanged first thou art deceived in me friar but no more of this canst thou tell if claudio die to morrow or no why should he die sir why for filling a bottle with a tundish i would the duke we talk of were returned again the ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with continency sparrows must not build in his house eaves because they are lecherous the duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered he would never bring them to light would he were returned marry this claudio is condemned for untrussing farewell good friar i prithee pray for me the duke i say to thee again would eat mutton on fridays he 's not past it yet and i say to thee he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown bread and garlic say that i said so farewell exit no might nor greatness in mortality can censure scape back wounding calumny the whitest virtue strikes what king so strong can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue but

societies secure but security enough to make fellowships accurst much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world this news is old enough yet it is every day 's news i pray you sir of what disposition was the duke one that above all other strifes contended especially to know himself what pleasure was he given to rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at any thing which professed to make him rejoice a gentleman of all temperance but leave we him to his events with a prayer they may prove prosperous and let me desire to know how you find claudio prepared i am made to understand that you have lent him visitation he professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice yet had he framed to himself by the instruction of his frailty many deceiving promises of life which i by my good leisure have discredited to him and now is he resolved to die you have paid the heavens your function and the prisoner the very debt of your calling i have laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty but my brother justice have i found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him

hark what noise heaven give your spirits comfort exit claudio by and by i hope it is some pardon or reprieve for the most gentle claudio enter duke vincentio disguised as before welcome father the best and wholesomest spirts of the night envelope you good provost who call'd here of late none since the curfew rung not isabel no they will then ere't be long what comfort is for claudio there 's some in hope it is a bitter deputy not so not so his life is parallel'd even with the stroke and line of his great justice he doth with holy abstinence subdue that in himself which he spurs on his power to qualify in others were he meal'd with that which he corrects then were he tyrannous but this being so he 's just knocking within now are they come exit provost this is a gentle provost seldom when the steeled gaoler is the friend of men knocking within how now what noise that spirit 's possessed with haste that wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes re enter provost there he must stay until the officer arise to let him in he is call'd up have you no countermand for claudio yet but he must die to morrow none sir none as near the dawning provost as it is you shall hear more ere morning happily you something know yet i believe there comes no countermand no such example have we besides upon the very siege of justice lord angelo hath to the public ear profess'd the contrary enter a messenger this is his lordship 's man and here comes claudio 's pardon giving a paper my lord hath sent you this note and by me this further charge that you swerve not from the smallest article of it neither in time matter or other circumstance good morrow for as i take it it is almost day i shall obey him exit messenger aside   this is his pardon purchased by such sin for which the pardoner himself is in hence hath offence his quick celerity when it is born in high authority when vice makes mercy mercy 's so extended that for the fault 's love is the offender friended now sir what news i told you lord angelo belike thinking me remiss in mine office awakens me with this unwonted putting on methinks strangely for he hath not used it before pray you let 's hear reads whatsoever you may hear to the contrary let claudio be executed by four of the clock and in the afternoon barnardine for my better satisfaction let me have claudio 's head sent me by five let this be duly performed with a thought that more depends on it than we must yet deliver thus fail not to do your office as you will answer it at your peril what say you to this sir what is that barnardine who is to be executed in the afternoon a bohemian born but here nursed un and bred one that is a prisoner nine years old how came it that the absent duke had not either delivered him to his liberty or executed him i have heard it was ever his manner to do so his friends still wrought reprieves for him and indeed his fact till now in the government of lord angelo came not to an undoubtful proof it is now apparent most manifest and not denied by himself hath he born himself penitently in prison how seems he to be touched a man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless of what 's past present or to come insensible of mortality and desperately mortal he wants advice he will hear none he hath evermore had the liberty of the prison give him leave to escape hence he would not drunk many times a day if not many days entirely drunk we have very oft awaked him as if to carry him to execution and showed him a seeming warrant for it it hath not moved him at all more of him anon there is written in your brow provost honesty and constancy if i read it not truly my ancient skill beguiles me but in the boldness of my cunning i will lay myself in hazard claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath sentenced him to make you understand this in a manifested effect i crave but four days respite for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy pray sir in what in the delaying death a lack how may i do it having the hour limited and an express command under penalty to deliver his head in the view of angelo i may make my case as claudio 's to cross this in the smallest by the vow of mine order i warrant you if my instructions may be your guide let this barnardine be this morning executed and his head born to angelo angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour o death 's a great disguiser and you may add to it shave the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death you know the course is common if any thing fall to you upon this more than thanks and good fortune by the saint whom i profess i will plead against it with my life pardon me good father it is against my oath were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy to him and to his substitutes you will think you have made no offence if the duke avouch the justice of your dealing but what likelihood is in that not a resemblance but a certainty yet since i see you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor persuasion can with ease attempt you i will go further than i meant to pluck all fears out of you look you sir here is the hand and seal of the duke you know the character i doubt not and the signet is not strange to you i know them both the contents of this is the return of the duke you shall anon over read it at your pleasure where you shall find within these two days he will be here this is a thing that angelo knows not for he this very day receives letters of strange tenor perchance of the duke 's death perchance entering into some monastery but by chance nothing of what is writ look the unfolding star calls up the shepherd put not yourself into amazement how these things should be all difficulties are but easy when they are known call your executioner and off with barnardine 's head i will

in most uneven and distracted manner his actions show much like to madness pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted and why meet him at the gates and redeliver our authorities there i guess not and why

credent bulk that no particular scandal once can touch but it confounds the breather he should have lived save that riotous youth with dangerous sense might in the times to come have ta'en revenge by

worthy cousin fairly met our old and faithful friend we are glad to see you happy return be to your royal grace many and hearty thankings to you both we have made inquiry of you and we hear such goodness of your justice that our soul can not but yield you forth to public thanks forerunning more requital you make my bonds still greater o your desert speaks loud and i should wrong it to lock it in the wards of covert bosom when it deserves with characters of brass a forted residence gainst the tooth of time and razure of oblivion give me your hand and let the subject see to make them know that outward courtesies would fain proclaim favours that keep within come escalus you must walk by us on our other hand and good supporters are you friar peter and isabella come forward now is your time speak loud and kneel before him justice o royal duke vail your regard upon a wrong'd i would fain have said a maid o worthy prince dishonour not your eye by throwing it on any other object till you have heard me in my true complaint and given me justice justice justice justice relate your wrongs in what by whom be brief here is lord angelo shall give you justice reveal yourself to him o worthy duke you bid me seek redemption of the devil hear me yourself for that which i must speak must either punish me not being believed or wring redress from you hear me o hear me here my lord her wits i fear me are not firm she hath been a suitor to me for her brother cut off by course of justice,-- by course of justice and she will speak most bitterly and strange most strange but yet most truly will i speak that angelo 's forsworn is it not strange that angelo 's a murderer is t not strange that angelo is an adulterous thief an hypocrite a virgin violator is it not strange and strange nay it is ten times strange it is not truer he is angelo than this is all as true as it is strange nay it is ten times true for truth is truth to the end of reckoning away with her poor soul she speaks this in the infirmity of sense o prince i conjure thee as thou believest there is another comfort than this world that thou neglect me not with that opinion that i am touch'd with madness make not impossible that which but seems unlike tis not impossible but one the wicked'st caitiff on the ground may seem as shy as grave as just as absolute as angelo even so may angelo in all his dressings characts titles forms be an arch villain believe it royal prince if he be less he 's nothing but he 's more had i more name for badness by mine honesty if she be mad,--as i believe no other,-- her madness hath the oddest frame of sense such a dependency of thing on thing as e'er i heard in madness o gracious duke harp not on that nor do not banish reason for inequality but let your reason serve to make the truth appear where it seems hid and hide the false seems true many that are not mad have sure more lack of reason what would you say i am the sister of one claudio condemn'd upon the act of fornication to lose his head condemn'd by angelo i in probation of a sisterhood was sent to by my brother one lucio as then the messenger,-- that 's i an't like your grace i came to her from claudio and desired her to try her gracious fortune with lord angelo for her poor brother 's pardon that 's he indeed you were not bid to speak no my good lord nor wish'd to hold my peace i wish you now then pray you take note of it and when you have a business for yourself pray heaven you then be perfect i warrant your honour the warrants for yourself take heed to't this gentleman told somewhat of my tale,-- right it may be right but you are i the wrong to speak before your time proceed i went to this pernicious caitiff deputy,-- that 's somewhat madly spoken pardon it the phrase is to the matter mended again the matter proceed in brief to set the needless process by how i persuaded how i pray'd and kneel'd how he refell'd me and how i replied,-- for this was of much length,--the vile conclusion i now begin with grief and shame to utter he would not but by gift of my chaste body to his concupiscible intemperate lust release my brother and after much debatement my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour and i did yield to him but the next morn betimes his purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant for my poor brother 's head this is most likely o that it were as like as it is true by heaven fond wretch thou knowist not what thou speak'st or else thou art suborn'd against his honour in hateful practise first his integrity stands without blemish next it imports no reason that with such vehemency he should pursue faults proper to himself if he had so offended he would have weigh'd thy brother by himself and not have cut him off some one hath set you on confess the truth and say by whose advice thou camest here to complain and is this all then o you blessed ministers above keep me in patience and with ripen'd time unfold the evil which is here wrapt up in countenance heaven shield your grace from woe as i thus wrong'd hence unbelieved go i know you'ld fain be gone an officer to prison with her shall we thus permit a blasting and a scandalous breath to fall on him so near us this needs must be a practise who knew of your intent and coming hither one that i would were here friar lodowick a ghostly father belike who knows that lodowick my lord i know him tis a meddling friar i do not like the man had he been lay my lord for certain words he spake against your grace in your retirement i had swinged him soundly words against me this is a good friar belike and to set on this wretched woman here against our substitute let this friar be found but yesternight my lord she and that friar i saw them at the prison a saucy friar a very scurvy fellow blessed be your royal grace i have stood by my lord and i have heard your royal ear abused first hath this woman most wrongfully accused your substitute who is as free from touch or soil with her as she from one ungot we did believe no less know you that friar lodowick that she speaks of i know him for a man divine and holy not scurvy nor a temporary meddler as he 's reported by this gentleman and on my trust a man that never yet did as he vouches misreport your grace my lord most villanously believe it well he in time may come to clear himself but at this instant he is sick my lord of a strange fever upon his mere request being come to knowledge that there was complaint intended gainst lord angelo came i hither to speak as from his mouth what he doth know is true and false and what he with his oath and all probation will make up full clear whensoever he 's convented first for this woman to justify this worthy nobleman so vulgarly and personally accused her shall you hear disproved to her eyes till she herself confess it good friar let 's hear it isabella is carried off guarded and mariana comes forward do you not smile at this lord angelo o heaven the vanity of wretched fools give us some seats come cousin angelo in this i 'll be impartial be you judge of your own cause is this the witness friar first let her show her face and after speak pardon my lord i will not show my face until my husband bid me what are you married no my lord are you a maid no my lord a widow then neither my lord why you are nothing then neither maid widow nor wife my lord she may be a punk for many of them are neither maid widow nor wife silence that fellow i would he had some cause to prattle for himself well my lord my lord i do confess i ne'er was married and i confess besides i am no maid i have known my husband yet my husband knows not that ever he knew me he was drunk then my lord it can be no better for the benefit of silence would thou wert so too well my lord this is no witness for lord angelo now i come to't my lord she that accuses him of fornication in self same manner doth accuse my husband and charges him my lord with such a time when i 'll depose i had him in mine arms with all the effect of love charges she more than me not that i know no you say your husband why just my lord and that is angelo who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body but knows he thinks that he knows isabel 's this is a strange abuse let 's see thy face my husband bids me now i will unmask unveiling this is that face thou cruel angelo which once thou sworest was worth the looking on this is the hand which with a vow'd contract was fast belock'd in thine this is the body that took away the match from isabel and did supply thee at thy garden house in her imagined person know you this woman carnally she says sirrah no more enough my lord my lord i must confess i know this woman and five years since there was some speech of marriage betwixt myself and her which was broke off partly for that her promised proportions came short of composition but in chief for that her reputation was disvalued in levity since which time of five years i never spake with her saw her nor heard from her upon my faith and honour noble prince as there comes light from heaven and words from breath as there is sense in truth and truth in virtue i am affianced this man 's wife as strongly as words could make up vows and my good lord but tuesday night last gone in 's garden house he knew me as a wife as this is true let me in safety raise me from my knees or else for ever be confixed here a marble monument i did but smile till now now good my lord give me the scope of justice my patience here is touch'd i do perceive these poor informal women are no more but instruments of some more mightier member that sets them on let me have way my lord to find this practise out ay with my heart and punish them to your height of pleasure thou foolish friar and thou pernicious woman compact with her that 's gone think'st thou thy oaths though they would swear down each particular saint were testimonies against his worth and credit that 's seal'd in approbation you lord escalus sit with my cousin lend him your kind pains to find out this abuse whence tis derived there is another friar that set them on let him be sent for would he were here my lord for he indeed hath set the women on to this complaint your provost knows the place where he abides and he may fetch him go do it instantly exit provost and you my noble and well warranted cousin whom it concerns to hear this matter forth do

would speak with her exit an attendant pray you my lord give me leave to question you shall see how i 'll handle her not better than he by her own report say you marry sir i think if you handled her

worthy man but in foul mouth and in the witness of his proper ear to call him villain and then to glance from him to the duke himself to tax him with injustice take him hence to the rack with him we 'll touse you joint by joint but we will know his purpose what unjust be not so hot the duke dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he dare rack his own his subject am i not nor here provincial my business in this state made me a looker on here in vienna where i have seen corruption boil and bubble till it o'er run the stew laws for all faults but faults so countenanced that the strong

business not changing heart with habit i am still attorney'd at your service o give me pardon that i your vassal have employ'd and pain'd your unknown sovereignty you are pardon'd isabel and now dear maid be you as free to us your brother 's death i know sits at your heart and you may marvel why i obscured myself labouring to save his life and would not rather make rash remonstrance of my hidden power than let him so be lost o most kind maid it was the swift celerity of his death which i did think with slower foot came on that brain'd my purpose but peace be with him that life is better life past fearing death than that which lives to fear make it your comfort so happy is your brother i do my lord re enter angelo mariana friar peter and provost for this new married man approaching here whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd your well defended honour you must pardon for mariana 's sake but as he adjudged your brother,-- being criminal in double violation of sacred chastity and of promise breach thereon dependent for your brother 's life,-- the very mercy of the law cries out most audible even from his proper tongue an angelo for claudio death for death haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure like doth quit like and measure still for measure then angelo thy fault 's thus manifested which though thou wouldst deny denies thee vantage we do condemn thee to the very block where claudio stoop'd to death and with like haste away with him o my most gracious lord i hope you will not mock me with a husband it is your husband mock'd you with a husband consenting to the safeguard of your honour i thought your marriage fit else imputation for that he knew you might reproach your life and choke your good to come for his possessions although by confiscation they are ours we do instate and widow you withal to buy you a better husband o my dear lord i crave no other nor no better man never crave him we are definitive gentle my liege,-- kneeling you do but lose your labour away with him to death to lucio now sir to you o my good lord sweet isabel take my part lend me your knees and all my life to come i 'll lend you all my life to do you service against all sense you do importune her should she kneel down in mercy of this fact her brother 's ghost his paved bed would break and take her hence in horror isabel sweet isabel do yet but kneel by me hold up your hands say nothing i 'll speak all they say best men are moulded out of faults and for the most become much more the better for being a little bad so may my husband o isabel will you not lend a knee he dies for claudio 's death most bounteous sir kneeling look if it please you on this man condemn'd as if my brother lived i partly think a due sincerity govern'd his deeds till he did look on me since it is so let him not die my brother had but justice in that he did the thing for which he died for angelo his act did not o'ertake his bad intent and must be buried but as an intent that perish'd by the way thoughts are no subjects intents but merely thoughts merely my lord your suit 's unprofitable stand up i say i have bethought me of another fault provost how came it claudio was beheaded at an unusual hour it was commanded so had you a special warrant for the deed no my good lord it was by private message for which i do discharge you of your office give up your keys pardon me noble lord i thought it was a fault but knew it not yet did repent me after more advice for testimony whereof one in the prison that should by private order else have died i have reserved alive what 's he his name

winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of york and all the clouds that lour'd upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths our bruised arms hung up for monuments our stern alarums changed to merry meetings our dreadful marches to delightful measures grim visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front and now instead of mounting barded steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries he capers nimbly in a lady 's chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks nor made to court an amorous looking glass i that am rudely stamp'd and want love 's majesty to strut before a wanton ambling nymph i that am curtail'd of this fair proportion cheated of feature by dissembling nature deformed unfinish'd sent before my time into this breathing world scarce half made up and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by them why i in this weak piping time of peace have no delight to pass away the time unless to spy my shadow in the sun and descant on mine own deformity and therefore since i can not prove a lover to entertain these fair well spoken days i am determined to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days plots have i laid inductions dangerous by drunken prophecies libels and dreams to set my brother clarence and the king in deadly hate the one against the other and if king edward be as true and just as i am subtle false and treacherous this day should clarence closely be mew'd up about a prophecy which says that g of edward 's heirs the murderer shall be dive thoughts down to my soul here clarence comes enter clarence guarded and brakenbury brother good day what means this armed guard that waits upon your grace his majesty tendering my person 's safety hath appointed this conduct to convey me to the tower upon what cause because my name is george alack my lord that fault is none of yours he should for that commit your godfathers o belike his majesty hath some intent that you shall be new christen'd in the tower but what 's the matter clarence   may i know yea richard when i know for i protest as yet i do not but as i can learn he hearkens after prophecies and dreams and from the cross row plucks the letter g. and says a wizard told him that by g his issue disinherited should be and for my name of george begins with g it follows in his thought that i am he these as i learn and such like toys as these have moved his highness to commit me now why this it is when men are ruled by women tis not the king that sends you to the tower my lady grey his wife clarence tis she that tempers him to this extremity was it not she and that good man of worship anthony woodville her brother there that made him send lord hastings to the tower from whence this present day he is deliver'd we are not safe clarence we are not safe by heaven i think there 's no man is secure but the queen 's kindred and night walking heralds that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore heard ye not what an humble suppliant lord hastings was to her for his delivery humbly complaining to her deity got my lord chamberlain his liberty i 'll tell you what i think it is our way if we will keep in favour with the king to be her men and wear her livery the jealous o'erworn widow and herself since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen are mighty gossips in this monarchy i beseech your graces both to pardon me his majesty hath straitly given in charge that no man shall have private conference of what degree soever with his brother even so an't please your worship brakenbury you may partake of any thing we say we speak no treason man we say the king is wise and virtuous and his noble queen well struck in years fair and not jealous we say that shore 's wife hath a pretty foot a cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue and that the queen 's kindred are made gentle folks how say you sir can you deny all this with this my lord myself have nought to do naught to do with mistress shore i tell thee fellow he that doth naught with her excepting one were best he do it secretly alone what one my lord her husband knave wouldst thou betray me i beseech your grace to pardon me and withal forbear your conference with the noble duke we know thy charge brakenbury and will obey we are the queen 's abjects and must obey brother farewell i will unto the king and whatsoever you will employ me in were it to call king edward 's widow sister i will perform it to enfranchise you meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood touches me deeper than you can imagine i know it pleaseth neither of us well well your imprisonment shall not be long meantime have patience i must perforce farewell exeunt clarence brakenbury and guard go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return simple plain clarence i do love thee so that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven if heaven will take the present at our hands but who comes here the new deliver'd hastings enter hastings good time of day unto my gracious lord as much unto my good lord chamberlain well are you welcome to the open air how hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment with patience noble lord as prisoners must but i shall live my lord to give them thanks that were the cause of my imprisonment no doubt no doubt and so shall clarence too for they that were your enemies are his and have prevail'd as much on him as you more pity that the eagle should be mew'd while kites and buzzards prey at liberty what news abroad no news so bad abroad as this at home the king is sickly weak and melancholy and his physicians fear him mightily now by saint paul this news is bad indeed o he hath kept an evil diet long and overmuch consumed his royal person tis very grievous to be thought upon what is he in his bed he is go you before and i will follow you exit hastings he can not live i hope and must not die till george be pack'd with post horse up to heaven i 'll in to urge his hatred more to clarence with lies well steel'd with weighty arguments and if i fall not in my deep intent clarence hath not another day to live which done god take king edward to his mercy and leave the world for me to bustle in for then i 'll marry warwick 's youngest daughter what though i kill'd her husband and her father the readiest way to make the wench amends is to become her husband and her father the which will i not all so much for love as for another secret close intent by marrying her which i must reach unto but yet i run before my horse

anne wife to thy edward to thy slaughter'd son stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds lo in these windows that let forth thy life i pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it cursed the blood that let this blood from hence more direful hap betide that hated wretch that makes us wretched by the death of thee than i can wish to adders spiders toads or any creeping venom'd thing that lives if ever he have child abortive be it prodigious and untimely brought to light whose ugly and unnatural aspect may fright the hopeful mother at the view and that be heir to his unhappiness if ever he have wife let her he made a miserable by the death of him as i am made by my poor lord and thee come now

boldness what do you tremble are you all afraid alas i blame you not for you are mortal and mortal eyes can not endure the devil avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell thou hadst but power over his mortal body his soul thou canst not have therefore be gone sweet saint for charity be not so curst foul devil for god 's sake hence and trouble us not for thou hast made the happy earth thy hell fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds behold this pattern of thy butcheries o gentlemen see see dead henry 's wounds open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh blush blush thou lump of foul deformity for tis thy presence that exhales this blood from cold and empty veins where no blood dwells thy deed inhuman and unnatural provokes this deluge most unnatural o god which this blood madest revenge his death o earth which this blood drink'st revenge his death either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead or earth gape open wide and eat him quick as thou dost swallow up this good king 's blood which his hell govern'd arm hath butchered lady you know no rules of charity which renders good for bad blessings for curses villain thou know'st no law of god nor man no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity but i know none and therefore am no beast o wonderful when devils tell the truth more wonderful when angels are so angry vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman of these supposed evils to give me leave by circumstance but to acquit myself vouchsafe defused infection of a man for these known evils but to give me leave by circumstance to curse thy cursed self fairer than tongue can name thee let me have some patient leisure to excuse myself fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make no excuse current but to hang thyself by such despair i should accuse myself and by despairing shouldst thou stand excused for doing worthy vengeance on thyself which didst unworthy slaughter upon others say that i slew them not why then they are not dead but dead they are and devilish slave by thee i did not kill your husband why then he is alive nay he is dead and slain by edward 's hand in thy foul throat thou liest queen margaret saw thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood the which thou once didst bend against her breast but that thy brothers beat aside the point i was provoked by her slanderous tongue which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind which never dreamt on aught but butcheries didst thou not kill this king i grant ye dost grant me hedgehog then god grant me too thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed o he was gentle mild and virtuous the fitter for the king of heaven that hath him he is in heaven where thou shalt never come let him thank me that holp to send him thither for he was fitter for that place than earth and thou unfit for any place but hell yes one place else if you will hear me name it some dungeon your bed chamber i 'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest so will it madam till i lie with you i hope so i know so but gentle lady anne to leave this keen encounter of our wits and fall somewhat into a slower method is not the causer of the timeless deaths of these plantagenets henry and edward as blameful as the executioner thou art the cause and most accursed effect your beauty was the cause of that effect your beauty which did haunt me in my sleep to undertake the death of all the world so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom if i thought that i tell thee homicide these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks these eyes could never endure sweet beauty 's wreck you should not blemish it if i stood by as all the world is cheered by the sun so i by that it is my day my life black night o'ershade thy day and death thy life curse not thyself fair creature thou art both i would i were to be revenged on thee it is a quarrel most unnatural to be revenged on him that loveth you it is a quarrel just and reasonable to be revenged on him that slew my husband he that bereft thee lady of thy husband did it to help thee to a better husband his better doth not breathe upon the earth he lives that loves thee better than he could name him plantagenet why that was he the selfsame name but one of better nature where is he here she spitteth at him why dost thou spit at me would it were mortal poison for thy sake never came poison from so sweet a place never hung poison on a fouler toad out of my sight thou dost infect my eyes thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine would they were basilisks to strike thee dead i would they were that i might die at once for now they kill me with a living death those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears shamed their aspect with store of childish drops these eyes that never shed remorseful tear no when my father york and edward wept to hear the piteous moan that rutland made when black faced clifford shook his sword at him nor when thy warlike father like a child told the sad story of my father 's death and twenty times made pause to sob and weep that all the standers by had wet their cheeks like trees bedash'd with rain in that sad time my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear and what these sorrows could not thence exhale thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping i never sued to friend nor enemy my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word but now thy beauty is proposed my fee my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak she looks scornfully at him teach not thy lips such scorn for they were made for kissing lady not for such contempt if thy revengeful heart can not forgive lo here i lend thee this sharp pointed sword which if thou please to hide in this true bosom and let the soul forth that adoreth thee i lay it naked to the deadly stroke and humbly beg the death upon my knee he lays his breast open she offers at it with his sword nay do not pause for i did kill king henry but twas thy beauty that provoked me nay now dispatch twas i that stabb'd young edward but twas thy heavenly face that set me on here she lets fall the sword take up the sword again or take up me arise dissembler though i wish thy death i will not be the executioner then bid me kill myself and i will do it i have already tush that was in thy rage speak it again and even with the word that hand which for thy love did kill thy love shall for thy love kill a far truer love to both their deaths thou shalt be accessary i would i knew thy heart tis figured in my tongue i fear me both are false then never man was true well well put up your sword say then my peace is made that shall you know hereafter but shall i live in hope all men i hope live so vouchsafe to wear this ring to take is not to give look how this ring encompasseth finger even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart wear both of them for both of them are thine and if thy poor devoted suppliant may but beg one favour at thy gracious hand thou dost confirm his happiness for ever what is it that it would please thee leave these sad designs to him that hath more cause to be a mourner and presently repair to crosby place where after i have solemnly interr'd at chertsey monastery this noble king and wet his grave with my repentant tears i will with all expedient duty see you for divers unknown reasons i beseech you grant me this boon with all my heart and much it joys me too to see you are become so penitent tressel and berkeley go along with me bid me farewell tis more than you deserve but since you teach me how to flatter you imagine i have

yet to win her all the world to nothing ha hath she forgot already that brave prince edward her lord whom i some three months since stabb'd in my angry mood at tewksbury a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman framed in the prodigality of nature young valiant wise and no doubt right royal the spacious world can not again afford and will she yet debase her eyes on me that cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince and made her widow to a woful bed on me whose all not equals edward 's moiety on me that halt and am unshapen thus my dukedom to a beggarly denier i do mistake my person all this

burgundy and in my company my brother gloucester who from my cabin tempted me to walk upon the hatches thence we looked toward england and cited up a thousand fearful times during the wars of york and lancaster that had befall'n us as we paced along upon the giddy footing of the hatches methought that gloucester stumbled and in falling struck me that thought to stay him overboard into the tumbling billows of the main lord lord methought what pain it was to drown what dreadful noise of waters in mine ears what ugly sights of death within mine eyes methought i saw a thousand fearful wrecks ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl inestimable stones unvalued jewels all scatter'd in the bottom of the sea some lay in dead men 's skulls and in those holes where eyes did once inhabit there were crept as twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep and mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by had you such leisure in the time of death to gaze upon the secrets of the deep methought i had and often did i strive to yield the ghost but still the envious flood kept in my soul and would not let it forth to seek the empty vast and wandering air but smother'd it within my panting bulk which almost burst to belch it in the sea awaked you not with this sore agony o no my dream was lengthen'd after life o then began the tempest to my soul who pass'd methought the melancholy flood with that grim ferryman which poets write of unto the kingdom of perpetual night the first that there did greet my stranger soul was my great father in law renowned warwick who cried aloud what scourge for perjury can this dark monarchy afford false clarence and so he vanish'd then came wandering by a shadow like an angel with bright hair dabbled in blood and he squeak'd out aloud clarence is come false fleeting perjured clarence that stabb'd me in the field by tewksbury seize on him furies take him to your torments with that methoughts a legion of foul fiends environ'd me about and howled in mine ears such hideous cries that with the very noise i trembling waked and for a season after could not believe but that i was in hell such terrible impression made the dream no marvel my lord though it affrighted you i promise i am afraid to hear you tell it o brakenbury i have done those things which now bear evidence against my soul for edward 's sake and see how he requites me o god if my deep prayers can not appease thee but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds yet execute thy wrath in me alone o spare my guiltless wife and my poor children i pray thee gentle keeper stay by me my soul is heavy and i fain would sleep i will my lord god give your grace good rest clarence sleeps sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours makes the night morning and the noon tide night princes have but their tides for their glories an outward honour for an inward toil and for unfelt imagination they often feel a world of restless cares so that betwixt their tides and low names there 's nothing differs but the outward fame enter the two murderers ho who 's here in god 's name what are you and how came you hither i would speak with clarence and i came hither on my legs yea are you so brief o sir it is better to be brief than tedious show him our commission talk no more brakenbury reads it i am in this commanded to deliver the noble duke of clarence to your hands i will not reason what is meant hereby because i will be guiltless of the meaning here are the keys there sits the duke asleep i 'll to the king and signify to him that thus i have resign'd my charge to you do so it is a point of wisdom fare you well exit brakenbury what shall we stab him as he sleeps no then he will say twas done cowardly when he wakes when he wakes why fool he shall never wake till the judgment day why then he will say we stabbed him sleeping the urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind of remorse in me what art thou afraid not to kill him having a warrant for it but to be damned for killing him from which no warrant can defend us i thought thou hadst been resolute so i am to let him live back to the duke of gloucester tell him so i pray thee stay a while i hope my holy humour will change twas wo nt to hold me but while one would tell twenty how dost thou feel thyself now faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me remember our reward when the deed is done zounds he dies i had forgot the reward where is thy conscience now in the duke of gloucester 's purse so when he opens his purse to give us our reward thy conscience flies out let it go there 's few or none will entertain it how if it come to thee again i 'll not meddle with it it is a dangerous thing it makes a man a coward a man can not steal but it accuseth him he can not swear but it cheques him he can not lie with his neighbour 's wife but it detects him tis a blushing shamefast spirit that mutinies in a man 's bosom it fills one full of obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold that i found it beggars any man that keeps it it is turned out of all towns and cities for a dangerous thing and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust to himself and to live without it zounds it is even now at my elbow persuading me not to kill the duke take the devil in thy mind and relieve him not he would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh tut i am strong framed he can not prevail with me i warrant thee spoke like a tail fellow that respects his reputation come shall we to this gear take him over the costard with the hilts of thy sword and then we will chop him in the malmsey butt in the next room o excellent devise make a sop of him hark he stirs shall i strike no first let 's reason with him where art thou keeper give me a cup of wine you shall have wine enough my lord anon in god 's name what art thou a man as you are but not as i am royal nor you as we are loyal thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble my voice is now the king 's my looks mine own how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak your eyes do menace me why look you pale who sent you hither wherefore do you come to to to-- to murder me ay ay you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so and therefore can not have the hearts to do it wherein my friends have i offended you offended us you have not but the king i shall be reconciled to him again never my lord therefore prepare to die are you call'd forth from out a world of men to slay the innocent what is my offence where are the evidence that do accuse me what lawful quest have given their verdict up unto the frowning judge or who pronounced the bitter sentence of poor clarence death before i be convict by course of law to threaten me with death is most unlawful i charge you as you hope to have redemption by christ 's dear blood shed for our grievous sins that you depart and lay no hands on me the deed you undertake is damnable what we will do we do upon command and he that hath commanded is the king erroneous vassal the great king of kings hath in the tables of his law commanded that thou shalt do no murder and wilt thou then spurn at his edict and fulfil a man 's take heed for he holds vengeance in his hands to hurl upon their heads that break his law and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee for false forswearing and for murder too thou didst receive the holy sacrament to fight in quarrel of the house of lancaster and like a traitor to the name of god didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign 's son whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend how canst thou urge god 's dreadful law to us when thou hast broke it in so dear degree alas for whose sake did i that ill deed for edward for my brother for his sake why sirs he sends ye not to murder me for this for in this sin he is as deep as i. if god will be revenged for this deed o know you yet he doth it publicly take not the quarrel from his powerful arm he needs no indirect nor lawless course to cut off those that have offended him who made thee then a bloody minister when gallant springing brave plantagenet

my death you are deceived your brother gloucester hates you o no he loves me and he holds me dear go you to him from me ay so we will tell him when that our princely father york bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm and charged us from his soul to love each other he little thought of this divided friendship bid gloucester think of this and he will weep ay millstones as be lesson'd us to weep o do not slander him for he is kind right as snow in harvest thou deceivest thyself tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee it can not be for when i parted with him he hugg'd me in his arms and swore with sobs that he would labour my delivery why so he doth now he delivers thee from this world 's thraldom to the joys of heaven make peace with god for you must die my lord hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul to counsel me to make my peace with god and art thou yet to thy own soul so blind that thou wilt war with god by murdering me ah sirs consider he that set you on to do this deed will hate you for the deed what shall we do relent and save your souls relent tis cowardly and womanish not to relent is beastly savage devilish which of you if you were a prince 's son being pent from liberty as i am now if two such murderers as yourselves came to you would not entreat for life my friend i spy some pity in thy looks o if thine eye be not a flatterer come thou on my side and entreat for me as you would beg were you in my distress a begging prince what beggar pities not look behind you my lord take that and that if all this will not do stabs him i 'll drown you in

punishment was cruel death who sued to me for him who in my rage kneel'd at my feet and bade me be advised who spake of brotherhood who spake of love who told me how the poor soul did forsake the mighty warwick and did fight for me who told me in the field by tewksbury when oxford had me down he rescued me and said dear brother live and be a king who told me when we both lay in the field frozen almost to death how he did lap me even in his own garments and gave himself all thin and naked to the numb cold night all this from my remembrance brutish wrath sinfully pluck'd and not a man

provoked by the queen devised impeachments to imprison him and when my uncle told me so he wept and hugg'd me in his arm and kindly kiss'd my cheek bade me rely on him as on my father and he would

may catch the king 's or like obedient subjects follow him to his new kingdom of perpetual rest ah so much interest have i in thy sorrow as i had title in thy noble husband i have bewept a worthy husband 's death and lived by looking on his images but now two mirrors of his princely semblance are crack'd in pieces by malignant death and i for comfort have but one false glass which grieves me when i see my shame in him thou art a widow yet thou art a mother and hast the comfort of thy children left thee but death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms and pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs edward and clarence o what cause have i thine being but a moiety of my grief to overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries good aunt you wept not for our father 's death how can we aid you with our kindred tears our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd your widow dolour likewise be unwept give me no help in lamentation i am not barren to bring forth complaints all springs reduce their currents to mine eyes that i being govern'd by the watery moon may send forth plenteous tears to drown the world oh for my husband for my dear lord edward oh for our father for our dear lord clarence alas for both both mine edward and clarence what stay had i but edward and he 's gone what stay had we but clarence and he 's gone what stays had i but they and they are gone was never widow had so dear a loss were never orphans had so dear a loss was never mother had so dear a loss alas i am the mother of these moans their woes are parcell'd mine are general she for an edward weeps and so do i

that is the butt end of a mother 's blessing i marvel why her grace did leave it out you cloudy princes and heart sorrowing peers that bear this mutual heavy load of moan now cheer each other in each other 's love though we have spent our harvest of this king we are to reap the harvest of his son the broken rancour of your high swoln hearts but lately splinter'd knit and join'd together must gently be preserved cherish'd and kept me seemeth good that with some little train forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fetch'd hither to london to be crown'd our king why with some little train my lord of buckingham marry my lord lest by a multitude the new heal'd wound of malice should break out which would be so much the more dangerous by how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd where every horse bears his commanding rein and may direct his course as please himself as well the fear of harm as harm apparent in my opinion ought to be prevented i hope the king made peace with all of us and the compact is firm and true in me and so in me and so i think in all yet since it is but green it should be put to no apparent likelihood of breach which haply by much company might be urged therefore i say with noble buckingham that it is meet so few should fetch the prince and so say i. then be it so and go we to determine who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow madam and you my mother will you go to give your censures in this weighty business with all our harts exeunt all but buckingham and gloucester my lord whoever journeys to the prince for god 's sake let not

grace his son shall reign woe to the land that 's govern'd by a child in him there is a hope of government that in his nonage council under him and in his full and ripen'd years himself no doubt shall then and till then govern well so stood the state when henry the sixth was crown'd in paris but at nine months old stood the state so no no good friends god wot for then this land was famously enrich'd with politic grave counsel then the king had virtuous uncles to protect his grace why so hath this both by the father and mother better it were they all came by the father or by the father there were none at all for emulation now who shall be nearest will touch us all too near if god prevent not o full of danger is the duke of gloucester and the queen 's sons and brothers haught and proud and were they to be ruled and not to rule this sickly land might solace as before come come we fear the worst all shall be well when clouds appear wise men put on their cloaks when great leaves fall the winter is at hand when the sun sets who doth not look for night untimely storms make men expect a dearth all may be well but if god sort it so tis more than we deserve or i expect truly the souls of men are full of dread ye can not reason almost with a man that looks not heavily and full of fear before the times of change still is it so by a divine instinct men 's minds mistrust ensuing

but i would not have it so why my young cousin it is good to grow grandam one night as we did sit at supper my uncle rivers talk'd how i did grow more than my brother ay quoth my uncle gloucester small herbs have grace great weeds do grow apace and since methinks i would not grow so fast because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste good faith good faith the saying did not hold in him that did object the same to thee he was the wretched'st thing when he was young so long a growing and so leisurely that if this rule were true he should be gracious why madam so no doubt he is i hope he is but yet let mothers doubt now by my troth if i had been remember'd i could have given my uncle 's grace a flout to touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine how my pretty york i pray thee let me hear it marry they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw a crust at two hours old twas full two years ere i could get a tooth grandam this would have been a biting jest i pray thee pretty

jet upon the innocent and aweless throne welcome destruction death and massacre i see as in a map the end of all accursed and unquiet wrangling days how many of you have mine eyes beheld my husband lost his life to get the crown and often up and down my sons were toss'd for me to joy and weep their gain and loss and being seated and domestic broils clean over blown themselves the conquerors make war upon themselves blood against blood self against self o preposterous and frantic outrage end thy damned spleen or let me die to look on death no more come come my boy we will to sanctuary madam

catesby and others welcome sweet prince to london to your chamber welcome dear cousin my thoughts sovereign the weary way hath made you melancholy no uncle but our crosses on the way have made it tedious wearisome and heavy i want more uncles here to welcome me sweet prince the untainted virtue of your years hath not yet dived into the world 's deceit nor more can you distinguish of a man than of his outward show which god he knows seldom or never jumpeth with the heart those uncles which you want were dangerous your grace attended to their sugar'd words but look'd not on the poison of their hearts god keep you from them and from such false friends god keep me from false friends but they were none my lord the mayor of london comes to greet you enter the lord mayor and his train god

queen your mother and your brother york have taken sanctuary the tender prince would fain have come with me to meet your grace but by his mother was perforce withheld fie what an indirect and peevish course is this of hers lord cardinal will your grace persuade the queen to send the duke of york unto his princely brother presently if she deny lord hastings go with him and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce my lord of buckingham if my weak oratory can from his mother win the duke of york anon expect him here but if she be obdurate to mild entreaties god in heaven forbid we should infringe the holy privilege of blessed sanctuary not for all this land would i be guilty of so deep a sin you are too senseless obstinate my lord too ceremonious and traditional weigh it but with the grossness of this age you break not sanctuary in seizing him the benefit thereof is always granted to those whose dealings have deserved the place and those who have the wit to claim the place this prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it and therefore in mine opinion can not have it then taking him from thence that is not there you break no privilege nor charter there oft have i heard of sanctuary men but sanctuary children ne'er till now my lord you shall o'er rule my mind for once come on lord hastings will you go with me i go my lord good lords make all the speedy haste you may exeunt cardinal and hastings say uncle gloucester if our brother come where shall we sojourn till our coronation where it seems best unto your royal self if i may counsel you some day or two your highness shall repose you at the tower then where you please and shall be thought most fit for your best health and recreation i do not like the tower of any place did julius caesar build that place my lord he did my gracious lord begin that place which since succeeding ages have re edified is it upon record or else reported successively from age to age he built it upon record my gracious lord but say my lord it were not register'd methinks the truth should live from age to age as twere retail'd to all posterity even to the general all ending day aside   so wise so young they say do never live long what say you uncle i say without characters fame lives long aside thus like the formal vice iniquity i moralize two meanings in one word that julius caesar was a famous man with what his valour did enrich his wit his wit set down to make his valour live death makes no conquest of this conqueror for now he lives in fame though not in life i 'll tell you what my cousin buckingham,-- what my gracious lord an if i live until i be a man i 'll win our ancient right in france again or die a soldier as i lived a king aside   short summers lightly have a forward spring enter young york hastings and the cardinal now in good time here comes the duke of york richard of york how fares our loving brother well my dread lord so must i call you now ay brother to our grief as it is yours too late he died that might have kept that title which by his death hath lost much majesty how fares our cousin noble lord of york i thank you gentle uncle o my lord you said that idle weeds are fast in growth the prince my brother hath outgrown me far he hath my lord and therefore is he idle o my fair cousin i must not say so then is he more beholding to you than i. he may command me as my sovereign but you have power in me as in a kinsman i pray you uncle give me this dagger my dagger little cousin with all my heart a beggar brother of my kind uncle that i know will give and being but a toy which is no grief to give a greater gift than that i 'll give my cousin a greater gift o that 's the sword to it a gentle cousin were it light enough o then i see you will part but with light gifts in weightier things you 'll say a beggar nay it is too heavy for your grace to wear i weigh it lightly were it heavier what would you have my weapon little lord i would that i might thank you as you call me how little my lord of york will still be cross in talk uncle your grace knows how to bear with him you mean to bear me not to bear with me uncle my brother mocks both you and me because that i am little like an ape he thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders with what a sharp provided wit he reasons to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle he prettily and aptly taunts himself so cunning and so young is wonderful my lord will't please you pass along myself and my good cousin buckingham will to your mother to entreat of her to meet you at the tower and welcome you what will you go unto the tower my lord my lord protector needs will have it so i shall not sleep in quiet at the tower why what should you fear marry my uncle clarence angry ghost my grandam told me he was murdered there i fear no uncles dead nor none that live i hope an if they live i hope i need not fear but come my lord and with a heavy heart thinking on them go i unto the tower a sennet exeunt all but gloucester buckingham and catesby think you my lord this little prating york was not incensed by his subtle mother to taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously no doubt no doubt o tis a parlous boy bold quick ingenious forward capable he is all the mother 's from the top to toe well let them rest come hither catesby thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend as closely to conceal what we impart thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way what think'st thou is it not an easy matter to make william lord hastings of our mind for the instalment of this noble duke in the seat royal of this famous isle he for his father 's sake so loves the prince that he will not be won to aught against him what think'st thou then of stanley what will he he will do all in all as hastings doth well then

provided as else i would be were the day prolong'd re enter bishop of ely where is my lord protector i have sent for these strawberries his grace looks cheerfully and smooth to day there 's some conceit or other likes him well when he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit i think there 's never a man in christendom that can less hide his love or hate than he for by his face straight shall you know his heart what of his heart perceive you in his face by any likelihood he show'd to day marry that with no man here he is offended for were he he had shown it in his looks i pray god he be

hellish charms the tender love i bear your grace my lord makes me most forward in this noble presence to doom the offenders whatsoever they be i say my lord they have deserved death then be your eyes the witness of this ill see how i am bewitch'd behold mine arm is like a blasted sapling wither'd up and this is edward 's wife that monstrous witch consorted with that harlot strumpet shore that by their witchcraft thus have marked me if they have done this thing my gracious lord-- if i thou protector of this damned strumpet-- tellest thou me of ifs   thou art a traitor off with his head now by saint paul i swear i will not dine until i see the same lovel and ratcliff look that it be done the rest that love me rise and follow me exeunt all but hastings ratcliff and lovel woe woe for england not a whit for me for i too fond might have prevented this stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm but i disdain'd it and did scorn to fly three times to day my foot cloth horse did stumble and startled when he look'd upon the tower as loath to bear me to the slaughter house o now i want the priest that spake to me i now repent i told the pursuivant as twere triumphing at mine enemies how they at pomfret bloodily were butcher'd and i myself secure in grace and favour o margaret margaret now thy heavy curse is lighted on poor hastings wretched head dispatch my lord the duke would be at dinner make a short shrift he longs to see your head o momentary grace of mortal men which we more hunt for than the grace of god who builds his hopes in air of your good looks lives like a drunken sailor on a mast ready with every nod to tumble down into the fatal bowels of the deep come come dispatch tis bootless to exclaim o bloody richard miserable england i prophesy the fearful'st time to thee that ever wretched age hath look'd upon come lead me to the block bear him my head they smile at me that shortly shall be dead exeunt scene v. the tower walls enter gloucester and buckingham in rotten armour marvellous ill favoured come cousin canst thou quake and change thy colour murder thy breath in the middle of a word and then begin again and stop again as if thou wert distraught and mad with terror tut i can counterfeit the deep tragedian speak and look back and pry on every side tremble and start at wagging of a straw intending deep suspicion ghastly looks are at my service like enforced smiles and both are ready in their offices at any time to grace my stratagems but what is catesby gone he is and see he brings the mayor along enter the lord mayor and catesby lord mayor,-- look to the drawbridge there hark a drum catesby o'erlook the walls lord mayor the reason we have sent-- look back defend thee here are enemies god and our innocency defend and guard us be patient they are friends ratcliff and lovel enter lovel and ratcliff with hastings head here is the head of that ignoble traitor the dangerous and unsuspected hastings so dear i loved the man that i must weep i took him for the plainest harmless creature that breathed upon this earth a christian made him my book wherein my soul recorded the history of all her secret thoughts so smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue that his apparent open guilt omitted i mean his conversation with shore 's wife he lived from all attainder of suspect well well he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor that ever lived would you imagine or almost believe were't not that by great preservation we live to tell it you the subtle traitor this day had plotted in the council house to murder me and my good lord of gloucester what had he so what think you we are turks or infidels or that we would against the form of law proceed thus rashly to the villain 's death but that the extreme peril of the case the peace of england and our persons safety enforced us to this execution now fair befall you he deserved his death and you my good lords both have well proceeded to warn false traitors from the like attempts i never look'd for better at his hands after he once fell in with mistress shore yet had not we determined he should die until your lordship came to see his death which now the loving haste of these our friends somewhat against our meaning have prevented because my lord we would have had you heard the traitor speak and timorously confess the manner and the purpose of his treason that you might well have signified the same unto the citizens who haply may misconstrue us in him and wail his death but my good lord your grace 's word shall serve as well as i had seen and heard him speak and doubt you not right noble princes both but i 'll acquaint our duteous citizens with all your just proceedings in this cause and to that end we wish'd your lord ship here to avoid the carping censures of the world but since you come too late of our intents yet witness what you hear we did intend and so my good lord mayor we bid farewell exit lord mayor go after after cousin buckingham the mayor towards guildhall hies him in all post there at your meet'st advantage of the time infer the bastardy of edward 's children tell them how edward put to death a citizen only for saying he would make his son heir to the crown meaning indeed his house which by the sign thereof was termed so moreover urge his hateful luxury and bestial appetite in change of lust which stretched to their servants daughters wives even where his lustful eye or savage heart without control listed to make his prey nay for a need thus far come near my person tell them when that my mother went with child of that unsatiate edward noble york my princely father then had wars in france and by just computation of the time found that the issue was not his begot which well appeared in his lineaments being nothing like the noble duke my father but touch this sparingly as twere far off because you know my lord my mother lives fear not my lord i 'll play the orator as if the golden fee for which i plead were for myself and so my lord adieu if you thrive well bring them to baynard 's castle where you shall find me well accompanied with reverend fathers and well learned bishops i go and towards three or four o'clock look for the news that the guildhall affords exit buckingham go lovel with all speed to doctor shaw to catesby go thou to friar penker bid them both meet me within this hour at baynard 's castle exeunt all but gloucester now will i in to take some privy order to draw the brats of clarence out of sight and to give notice that no manner of person at any time have recourse unto the princes exit scene vi the same enter a scrivener with a paper in his hand this is the indictment of the good lord hastings which in a set hand fairly is engross'd that it may be this day read over in paul 's and mark how well the sequel hangs together eleven hours i spent to write it over for yesternight by catesby was it brought me the precedent was full as long a doing and yet within these five hours lived lord hastings untainted unexamined free at liberty here 's a good world the while why who 's so gross that seeth not this palpable device yet who 's so blind but says he sees it not bad is the world and all will come to nought when such bad dealings must be seen in thought exit scene vii baynard 's castle enter gloucester and buckingham at several doors how now my lord what say the citizens now by the holy mother of our lord the citizens are mum and speak not a word touch'd you the bastardy of edward 's children i did with his contract with lady lucy and his contract by deputy in france the insatiate greediness of his desires and his enforcement of the city wives his tyranny for trifles his own bastardy as being got your father then in france his resemblance being not like the duke withal i did infer your lineaments being the right idea of your father both in your form and nobleness of mind laid open all your victories in scotland your dicipline in war wisdom in peace your bounty virtue fair humility indeed left nothing fitting for the purpose untouch'd or slightly handled in discourse and when mine oratory grew to an end i bid them that did love their country 's good cry god save richard england 's royal king ah and did they so no so god help me they spake not a word but like dumb statues or breathing stones gazed each on other and look'd deadly pale which when i saw i reprehended them and ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence his answer was the people were not wo nt to be spoke to but by the recorder then he was urged to tell my tale again thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferr'd but nothing spake in warrant from himself when he had done some followers of mine own at the lower end of the hall hurl'd up their caps and some ten voices cried god save king richard and thus i took the vantage of those few thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth i this general applause and loving shout argues your wisdoms and your love to richard and even here brake off and came away what tongueless blocks were they would not they speak no by my troth my lord will not the mayor then and his brethren come the mayor is here at hand intend some fear be not you spoke with but by mighty suit and look you get a prayer book in your hand and stand betwixt two churchmen good my lord for on that ground i 'll build a holy descant and be not easily won to our request play the maid 's part still answer nay and take it i go and if you plead as well for them as i can say nay to thee for myself no doubt well bring it to a happy issue go go up to the leads the lord mayor knocks exit gloucester enter the lord mayor and citizens welcome my lord i dance attendance here i think the duke will not be spoke withal enter catesby here comes his servant how now catesby what says he my lord he doth entreat your grace to visit him to morrow or next day he is within with two right reverend fathers divinely bent to meditation and no worldly suit would he be moved to draw him from his holy exercise return good catesby to thy lord again tell him myself the mayor and citizens in deep designs and matters of great moment no less importing than our general good are come to have some conference with his grace i 'll tell him what you say my lord exit ah ha my lord this prince is not an edward he is not lolling on a lewd day bed but on his knees at meditation not dallying with a brace of courtezans but meditating with two deep divines not sleeping to engross his idle body but praying to enrich his watchful soul happy were england would this gracious prince take on himself the sovereignty thereof but sure i fear we shall ne'er win him to it marry god forbid his grace should say us nay i fear he will re enter catesby how now catesby what says your lord my lord he wonders to what end you have assembled such troops of citizens to speak with him his grace not being warn'd thereof before my lord he fears you mean no good to him sorry i am my noble cousin should suspect me that i mean no good to him by heaven i come in perfect love to him and so once more return and tell his grace exit catesby when holy and devout religious men are at their beads tis hard to draw them thence so sweet is zealous contemplation enter gloucester aloft between two bishops catesby returns see where he stands between two clergymen two props of virtue for a christian prince to stay him from the fall of vanity and see a book of prayer in his hand true ornaments to know a holy man famous plantagenet most gracious prince lend favourable ears to our request and pardon us the interruption of thy devotion and right christian zeal my lord there needs no such apology i rather do beseech you pardon me who earnest in the service of my god neglect the visitation of my friends but leaving this what is your grace 's pleasure even that i hope which pleaseth god above and all good men of this ungovern'd isle i do suspect i have done some offence that seems disgracious in the city 's eyes and that you come to reprehend my ignorance you have my lord would it might please your grace at our entreaties to amend that fault else wherefore breathe i in a christian land then know it is your fault that you resign the supreme seat the throne majestical the scepter'd office of your ancestors your state of fortune and your due of birth the lineal glory of your royal house to the corruption of a blemished stock whilst in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts which here we waken to our country 's good this noble isle doth want her proper limbs her face defaced with scars of infamy her royal stock graft with ignoble plants and almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion which to recure we heartily solicit your gracious self to take on you the charge and kingly government of this your land not as protector steward substitute or lowly factor for another 's gain but as successively from blood to blood your right of birth your empery your own for this consorted with the citizens your very worshipful and loving friends and by their vehement instigation in this just suit come i to move your grace i know not whether to depart in silence or bitterly to speak in your reproof best fitteth my degree or your condition if not to answer you might haply think tongue tied ambition not replying yielded to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty which fondly you would here impose on me if to reprove you for this suit of yours so season'd with your faithful love to me then on the other side i cheque'd my friends therefore to speak and to avoid the first and then in speaking not to incur the last definitively thus i answer you your love deserves my thanks but my desert unmeritable shuns your high request first if all obstacles were cut away and that my path were even to the crown as my ripe revenue and due by birth yet so much is my poverty of spirit so mighty and so many my defects as i had rather hide me from my greatness being a bark to brook no mighty sea than in my greatness covet to be hid and in the vapour of my glory smother'd but god be thank'd there 's no need of me and much i need to help you if need were the royal tree hath left us royal fruit which mellow'd by the stealing hours of time will well become the seat of majesty and make no doubt us happy by his reign on him i lay what you would lay on me the right and fortune of his happy stars which god defend that i should wring from him my lord this argues conscience in your grace but the respects thereof are nice and trivial all circumstances well considered you say that edward is your brother 's son so say we too but not by edward 's wife for first he was contract to lady lucy-- your mother lives a witness to that vow-- and afterward by substitute betroth'd to bona sister to the king of france these both put by a poor petitioner a care crazed mother of a many children a beauty waning and distressed widow even in the afternoon of her best days made prize and purchase of his lustful eye seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts to base declension and loathed bigamy by her in his unlawful bed he got this edward whom our manners term the prince more bitterly could i expostulate save that for reverence to some alive i give a sparing limit to my tongue then good my lord take to your royal self this proffer'd benefit of dignity if non to bless us and the land withal yet to draw forth your noble ancestry from the corruption of abusing times unto a lineal true derived course do good my lord your citizens entreat you refuse not mighty lord this proffer'd love o make them joyful grant their lawful suit alas why would you heap these cares on me i am unfit for state and majesty i do beseech you take it not amiss i can not nor i will not yield to you if you refuse it,--as in love and zeal loath to depose the child your brother 's son as well we know your tenderness of heart and gentle kind effeminate remorse which we have noted in you to your kin and egally indeed to all estates,-- yet whether you accept our suit or no your brother 's son shall never reign our king but we will plant some other in the throne to the disgrace and downfall of your house and in this resolution here we leave you.-- come citizens zounds i 'll entreat no more o do not swear my lord of buckingham exit buckingham with the citizens call them again my lord and accept their suit do good my lord lest all the land do rue it would you enforce me to a world of care well call them again i am not made of stone but penetrable to your kind entreats albeit against my conscience and my soul re enter buckingham and the rest cousin of buckingham and you sage grave men since you will buckle fortune on my back to bear her burthen whether i will or no i must have patience to endure the load but if black scandal or foul faced reproach attend the sequel of your imposition your mere enforcement shall acquittance me from all the impure blots and stains thereof for god he knows and you may partly see how far i am from the desire thereof god bless your grace we see it and will say it in saying so you shall but say the truth then i salute you with this kingly title long live richard england 's royal king amen to morrow will it please you to be crown'd even when you please since you will have it so to morrow then we will attend your grace and so most joyfully we take our leave come let us to our holy task again farewell good cousin farewell gentle friends exeunt act iv scene i. before the tower

dry her weeping eyes therewith if this inducement force her not to love send her a story of thy noble acts tell her thou madest away her uncle clarence her uncle rivers yea and for her sake madest quick conveyance with her good aunt anne come come you mock me this is not the way to win our daughter there is no other way unless thou couldst put on some other shape and not be richard that hath done all this say that i did all this for love of her nay then indeed she can not choose but hate thee having bought love with such a bloody spoil look what is done can not be now amended men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes which after hours give leisure to repent if i did take the kingdom from your sons to make amends ill give it to your daughter if i have kill'd the issue of your womb to quicken your increase i will beget mine issue of your blood upon your daughter a grandam 's name is little less in love than is the doting title of a mother they are as children but one step below

your age the loss you have is but a son being king and by that loss your daughter is made queen i can not make you what amends i would therefore accept such kindness as i can dorset your son that with

marriage joys and when this arm of mine hath chastised the petty rebel dull brain'd buckingham bound with triumphant garlands will i come and lead thy daughter to a conqueror 's bed to whom i will retail my conquest won and she shall be sole victress caesar 's caesar what were i best to say her father 's brother would be her lord or shall i say her uncle or he that slew her brothers and her uncles under what title shall i woo for thee that god the law my honour and her love can make seem pleasing to her tender years infer fair england 's peace by this alliance which she shall purchase with still lasting war say that the king which may command entreats that at her hands which the king 's king forbids say she shall be a high and mighty queen to wail the tide as her mother doth say i will love her everlastingly but how long shall that title ever last sweetly in force unto her fair life 's end but how long fairly shall her sweet lie last so long as heaven and nature lengthens it so long as hell and richard likes of it say i her sovereign am her subject love but she your subject loathes such sovereignty be eloquent in my behalf to her an honest tale speeds best being plainly told then in plain terms tell her my loving tale plain and not honest is too harsh a style your reasons are too shallow and too quick o no my reasons are too deep and dead too deep and dead poor infants in

faith hath made a prey for worms what canst thou swear by now the time to come that thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast for i myself have many tears to wash hereafter time for time past wrong'd by thee the children live whose parents thou hast slaughter'd ungovern'd youth to wail it in their age the parents live whose children thou hast butcher'd old wither'd plants to wail it with their age

think on thy proteus when thou haply seest some rare note worthy object in thy travel wish me partaker in thy happiness when thou dost meet good hap and in thy danger if ever danger do environ thee

love how young leander cross'd the hellespont that 's a deep story of a deeper love for he was more than over shoes in love tis true for you are over boots in love and yet you never swum the hellespont over the boots nay give me not the boots no i will not for it boots thee not what to be in love where scorn is bought with groans coy looks with heart sore sighs one fading moment 's mirth with twenty watchful weary tedious nights if haply won perhaps a hapless gain if lost why then a grievous labour won however but a folly bought with wit or else a wit by folly vanquished so by your circumstance you call me fool so by your circumstance i fear you 'll prove tis love you cavil at i am not love love is your master for he masters you and he that is so yoked by a fool methinks should not be chronicled for wise yet writers say as in the sweetest bud the eating canker dwells so eating love inhabits in the finest wits of all and writers say as the most forward bud is eaten by the

me still a sheep true and thy master a shepherd nay that i can deny by a circumstance it shall go hard but i 'll prove it by another the shepherd seeks the sheep and not the sheep the shepherd but i seek my master and my master seeks not me therefore i am no sheep the sheep for fodder follow the shepherd the shepherd for food follows not the sheep thou for wages followest thy master thy master for wages follows not thee therefore thou art a sheep such another proof will make me cry baa but dost thou hear gavest thou my letter to julia ay sir i a lost mutton gave your letter to her a laced

astray twere best pound you nay sir less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter you mistake i mean the pound,--a pinfold from a pound to a pin fold it over and over tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover but what said she first nodding   ay nod ay why that 's noddy you mistook sir i say she did nod and you ask me if she did nod and i say ay and that set

whom that the contents will show say say who gave it thee valentine 's page and sent i think from proteus he would have given it you but i being in the way did in your name receive it pardon the fault i pray now by my modesty a goodly broker dare you presume to harbour wanton lines to whisper and conspire against my youth now trust me tis an office of great worth and you an officer fit for the

have the profferer construe ay fie fie how wayward is this foolish love that like a testy babe will scratch the nurse and presently all humbled kiss the rod how churlishly i chid lucetta hence when

impeachment to his age in having known no travel in his youth nor need'st thou much importune me to that whereon this month i have been hammering i have consider'd well his loss of time and how he can

thrives your love my tales of love were wo nt to weary you i know you joy not in a love discourse ay proteus but that life is alter'd now i have done penance for contemning love whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me with bitter fasts with penitential groans with nightly tears and daily heart sore sighs for in revenge of my contempt of love love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes and made them watchers of mine own heart 's sorrow o gentle proteus love 's a mighty lord and hath so humbled me as i confess there is no woe to his correction nor to his service no such joy on earth now no discourse except it be of love now can i break my fast dine sup and sleep upon the very naked name of love enough i read your fortune in your eye was this the idol that you worship so even she and is she not a heavenly saint no but she is an earthly paragon call her divine i will not flatter her o flatter me for love delights in praises when i was sick you gave me bitter pills and i must minister the like to you then speak the truth by her if not divine yet let her be a principality sovereign to all the creatures on the earth except my mistress sweet except not any except thou wilt except against my love have i not reason to prefer mine own and i will help thee to prefer her too she shall be dignified with this high honour-- to bear my lady 's train lest the base earth should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss and of so great a favour growing proud disdain to root the summer swelling flower and make rough winter everlastingly why valentine what braggardism is this pardon me proteus all i can is nothing to her whose worth makes other worthies nothing she is alone then let her alone not for the world why man she is mine own and i as rich in having such a jewel as twenty seas if all their sand were pearl the water nectar and the rocks pure gold forgive me that i do not dream on thee because thou see'st me dote upon my love my foolish rival that her father likes only for his possessions are so huge is gone with her along and i must after for love thou know'st is full of jealousy but she loves you ay and we are betroth'd nay more our marriage hour with all the

affairs to aid me with thy counsel go on before i shall inquire you forth i must unto the road to disembark some necessaries that i needs must use and then i 'll presently attend you will you make haste i will exit valentine even as one heat another heat expels or as one nail by strength drives out another so the remembrance of my former love is by a newer object quite forgotten is it mine or valentine 's praise her true perfection or my false transgression that makes me reasonless to reason thus she is fair and so is julia that i love-- that i did love for now my love is thaw'd which like a waxen image gainst a fire bears no impression of the thing it was methinks my zeal to valentine is cold and that i love him not as i was wo nt o but i love his lady too too much and that 's the reason i love him so little how shall i dote on her with more advice that thus without advice begin to love her tis but her picture i have yet beheld and that hath dazzled my reason 's light but when i look on her perfections there is no reason but i shall be blind if i can cheque my erring love i will if not to compass her i 'll use my skill exit scene v. the same a street enter speed and launce

lubber as thou reportest him to be why thou whoreson ass thou mistakest me why fool i meant not thee i meant thy master i tell thee my master is become a hot lover why i tell thee i care not though he

i shall be much forsworn and even that power which gave me first my oath provokes me to this threefold perjury love bade me swear and love bids me forswear o sweet suggesting love if thou hast sinned teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it at first i did adore a twinkling star but now i worship a celestial sun unheedful vows may heedfully be broken and he wants wit that wants resolved will to learn his wit to exchange the bad for better fie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd with twenty thousand soul confirming oaths i can not leave to love and yet i do but there i leave to love where i should love julia i lose and valentine i lose if i keep them i needs must lose myself if i lose them thus find i by their loss for valentine myself for julia silvia i to myself am dearer than a friend for love is still most precious in itself and silvia witness heaven that made her fair!-- shows julia but a swarthy ethiope i will forget that julia is alive remembering that my love to her is dead and valentine i 'll hold an enemy aiming at silvia as a sweeter friend i can not now prove constant to myself without some treachery used to valentine this night he meaneth with a corded ladder to climb celestial silvia 's chamber window myself in counsel his competitor now presently i 'll give her father notice of their disguising and pretended flight who all enraged will banish valentine for thurio he intends shall we d his daughter but valentine being gone i 'll quickly cross by some sly trick blunt thurio 's dull proceeding love lend me wings to make my purpose swift as thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift exit scene vii verona julia 's house enter julia and lucetta counsel lucetta gentle girl assist me and even in kind love i do conjure thee who art the table wherein all my thoughts are visibly character'd and engraved to lesson me and tell me some good mean how with my honour i may undertake a journey to my loving proteus alas the way is wearisome and long a true devoted pilgrim is not weary to measure kingdoms with his feeble steps much less shall she that hath love 's wings to fly and when the flight is made to one so dear of such divine perfection as sir proteus better forbear till proteus make return o know'st thou not his looks are my soul 's food pity the dearth that i have pined in by longing for that food so long a time didst thou but know the inly touch of love thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow as seek to quench the fire of love with words i do not seek to quench your love 's hot fire but qualify the fire 's extreme rage lest it should burn above the bounds of reason the more thou damm'st it up the more it burns the current that with gentle murmur glides thou know'st being stopp'd impatiently doth rage but when his fair course is not hindered he makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones giving a gentle kiss to every sedge he overtaketh in his pilgrimage and so by many winding nooks he strays with willing sport to the wild ocean then let me go and hinder not my course i 'll be as patient as a gentle stream and make a pastime of each weary step till the last step have brought me to my love and there i 'll rest as after much turmoil a blessed soul doth in elysium but in what habit will you go along not like a woman for i would prevent the loose encounters of lascivious men gentle lucetta fit me with such weeds as may beseem some well reputed page why then your ladyship must cut your hair no girl i 'll knit it up in silken strings with twenty odd conceited true love knots to be fantastic may become a youth of greater time than i shall show to be what fashion madam shall i make your breeches that fits as well as tell me good my lord what compass will you

a journey i fear me it will make me scandalized if you think so then stay at home and go not nay that i will not then never dream on infamy but go if proteus like your journey when you come no matter who 's displeased when you are gone i fear me he will scarce be pleased withal that is the least lucetta of my fear a thousand oaths an ocean of his tears and instances of infinite of love warrant me welcome to my proteus all these are servants to deceitful men base men that use them to so base effect but truer stars did govern proteus birth his words are bonds his oaths are oracles his love sincere his thoughts immaculate his tears pure messengers sent from his heart his heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth pray heaven he prove so when you come to him now as thou lovest me do him not that wrong to bear a hard opinion of his truth only deserve my love by loving him and presently go with me to my chamber to take a note of what i stand in need of to furnish me upon my longing

gracious lord that which i would discover the law of friendship bids me to conceal but when i call to mind your gracious favours done to me undeserving as i am my duty pricks me on to utter that which else no worldly good should draw from me know worthy prince sir valentine my friend this night intends to steal away your daughter myself am one made privy to the plot i know you have determined to bestow her on thurio whom your gentle daughter hates and should she thus be stol'n away from you it would be much vexation to your age thus for my duty 's sake i rather chose to cross my friend in his intended drift than by concealing it heap on your head a pack of sorrows which would press you down being unprevented to your timeless grave proteus i thank thee for thine honest care which to requite command me while i live this love of theirs myself have often seen haply when they have judged me fast asleep and oftentimes have purposed to forbid sir valentine her company and my court but fearing lest my jealous aim might err and so unworthily disgrace the man a rashness that i ever yet have shunn'd i gave him gentle looks thereby to find that which thyself hast now disclosed to me and that thou mayst perceive my fear of this knowing that tender youth is soon suggested i nightly lodge her in an upper tower the key whereof myself have ever kept and thence she can not be convey'd away know noble lord they have devised a mean how he her chamber window will ascend and with a corded ladder fetch her down for which the youthful lover now is gone and this way comes he with it presently where if it please you you may intercept him but good my lord do it so cunningly that my discovery be not aimed at for love of you not hate unto my friend hath made me publisher of this pretence upon mine honour he shall never know that i had any light from thee of this adieu my lord sir valentine is coming exit enter valentine sir valentine whither away so fast please it your grace there is a messenger that stays to bear my letters to my friends and i am going to deliver them be they of much import the tenor of them doth but signify my health and happy being at your court nay then no matter stay with me awhile i am to break with thee of some affairs that touch me near wherein thou must be secret tis not unknown to thee that i have sought to match my friend sir thurio to my daughter i know it well my lord and sure the match were rich and honourable besides the gentleman is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter can not your grace win her to fancy him no trust me she is peevish sullen froward proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty neither regarding that she is my child nor fearing me as if i were her father and may i say to thee this pride of hers upon advice hath drawn my love from her and where i thought the remnant of mine age should have been cherish'd by her child like duty i now am full resolved to take a wife and turn her out to who will take her in then let her beauty be her wedding dower for me and my possessions she esteems not what would your grace have me to do in this there is a lady in verona here whom i affect but she is nice and coy and nought esteems my aged eloquence now therefore would i have thee to my tutor-- for long agone i have forgot to court besides the fashion of the time is changed-- how and which way i may bestow myself to be regarded in her sun bright eye win her with gifts if she respect not words dumb jewels often in their silent kind more than quick words do move a woman 's mind but she did scorn a present that i sent her a woman sometimes scorns what best contents her send her another never give her o'er for scorn at first makes after love the more if she do frown tis not in hate of you but rather to beget more love in you if she do chide tis not to have you gone for why the fools are mad if left alone take no repulse whatever she doth say for get you gone she doth not mean away flatter and praise commend extol their graces though ne'er so black say they have angels faces that man that hath a tongue i say is no man if with his tongue he can not win a woman but she i mean is promised by her friends unto a youthful gentleman of worth and kept severely from resort of men that no man hath access by day to her why then i would resort to her by night ay but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe that no man hath recourse to her by night what lets but one may enter at her window her chamber is aloft far from the ground and built so shelving that one can not climb it without apparent hazard of his life why then a ladder quaintly made of cords to cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks would serve to scale another hero 's tower so bold leander would adventure it now as thou art a gentleman of blood advise me where i may have such a ladder when would you use it pray sir tell me that this very night for love is like a child that longs for every thing that he can come by by seven o'clock i 'll get you such a ladder but hark thee i will go to her alone how shall i best convey the ladder thither it will be light my lord that you may bear it under a cloak that is of any length a cloak as long as thine will serve the turn ay my good lord then let me see thy cloak i 'll get me one of such another length why any cloak will serve the turn my lord how shall i fashion me to wear a cloak i pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me what letter is this same what 's here to silvia and here an engine fit for my proceeding i 'll be so bold to break the seal for once reads my thoughts do harbour with my silvia nightly and slaves they are to me that send them flying o could their master come and go as lightly himself would lodge where senseless they are lying my herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them while i their king that hither them importune do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them because myself do want my servants fortune i curse myself for they are sent by me that they should harbour where their lord would be what 's here silvia this night i will enfranchise thee tis so and here 's the ladder for

love i ever bore my daughter or thyself be gone i will not hear thy vain excuse but as thou lovest thy life make speed from hence exit and why not death rather than living torment to die is to be banish'd from myself and silvia is myself banish'd from her is self from self a deadly banishment what light is light if silvia be not seen what joy is joy if silvia be not by unless it be to think that she is by and feed upon the shadow of perfection except i be by silvia in the night there is no music in the nightingale unless i look on silvia in the day there is no day for me to look upon she

banish'd from her sight since his exile she hath despised me most forsworn my company and rail'd at me that i am desperate of obtaining her this weak impress of love is as a figure trenched in ice which with an hour 's heat dissolves to water and doth lose his form a little time will melt her frozen thoughts and worthless valentine shall be forgot enter proteus how now sir proteus is your countryman according to our proclamation gone gone my good lord my daughter takes his going grievously a little time my lord will kill that grief so i believe but thurio thinks not so proteus the good conceit i hold of thee-- for thou hast shown some sign of good desert-- makes me the better to confer with thee longer than i prove loyal to your grace let me not live to look upon your grace thou know'st how willingly i would effect the match between sir thurio and my daughter i do my lord and also i think thou art not ignorant how she opposes her against my will she did my lord when valentine was here ay and perversely she persevers so what might we do to make the girl forget the love of valentine and love sir thurio the best way is to slander valentine with falsehood cowardice and poor descent three things that women highly hold in hate ay but she 'll think that it is spoke in hate ay if his enemy deliver it therefore it must with circumstance be spoken by one whom she esteemeth as his friend then you must undertake to slander him and that my lord i shall be loath to do tis an ill office for a gentleman especially against his very friend where your good word can not advantage him your slander never can endamage him therefore the office is indifferent being entreated to it by your friend you have prevail'd my lord if i can do it by ought that i can speak in his dispraise she shall not long continue love to him but say this weed her love from valentine it follows not that she will love sir thurio therefore as you unwind her love from him lest it should ravel and be good to none you must provide to bottom it on me which must be done by praising me as much as you in worth dispraise sir valentine and proteus we dare trust you in this kind because we know on valentine 's report you are already love 's firm votary and can not soon revolt and change your mind upon this warrant shall you have access where you with silvia may confer at large for she is lumpish heavy melancholy and for your friend 's sake will be glad of you where you may temper her by your persuasion to hate young valentine and love my friend as much as i can do i will effect but you sir thurio are not sharp enough you must lay lime to tangle her desires by wailful sonnets whose composed rhymes should be full fraught with serviceable vows ay much is the force of heaven bred poesy say that upon the altar of her beauty you sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart write till your ink be dry and with your tears moist it again and frame some feeling line that may discover

orleans having full scarce six thousand in his troop by three and twenty thousand of the french was round encompassed and set upon no leisure had he to enrank his men he wanted pikes to set before his archers instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges they pitched in the ground confusedly to keep the horsemen off from breaking in more than three hours the fight continued where valiant talbot above human thought enacted wonders with his sword and lance hundreds he sent to hell and none durst stand him here there and every where enraged he flew the french exclaim'd the devil was in arms all the whole army stood agazed on him his soldiers spying his undaunted spirit a talbot a talbot cried out amain and rush'd into the bowels of the battle here had the conquest fully been seal'd

may be gather'd by thy shape let my presumption not provoke thy wrath for i am sorry that with reverence i did not entertain thee as thou art be not dismay'd fair lady nor misconstrue the mind of

whose glory i was great in arms this loathsome sequestration have i had and even since then hath richard been obscured deprived of honour and inheritance but now the arbitrator of despairs just death kind umpire of men 's miseries with sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence i would his troubles likewise were expired that so he might recover what was lost enter richard plantagenet my lord your loving nephew now is come richard plantagenet my friend is he come richard ay noble uncle thus ignobly used your nephew late despised richard comes direct mine arms i may embrace his neck and in his

of a true plantagenet and for alliance sake declare the cause my father earl of cambridge lost his head that cause fair nephew that imprison'd me and hath detain'd me all my flowering youth within a loathsome dungeon there to pine was cursed instrument of his decease richard discover more at large what cause that was for i am ignorant and can not guess i will if that my fading breath permit and death approach not ere my tale be done henry the fourth grandfather to this king deposed his nephew richard edward 's son the first begotten and the lawful heir of edward king the third of that descent during whose reign the percies of the north finding his usurpation most unjust endeavor'd my advancement to the throne the reason moved these warlike lords to this was for that young king richard thus removed leaving no heir begotten of his body-- i was the next by birth and parentage for by my mother i derived am from lionel duke of clarence the third son to king edward the third whereas he from john of gaunt doth bring his pedigree being but fourth of that heroic line but mark as in this haughty attempt they laboured to plant the rightful heir i lost my liberty and they their lives long after this when henry the fifth succeeding his father bolingbroke did reign thy father earl of cambridge then derived from famous edmund langley duke of york marrying my sister that thy mother was again in pity of my hard distress levied an army weening to redeem and have install'd me in the diadem but as the rest so fell that noble earl and was beheaded thus the mortimers in whom the tide rested were suppress'd richard of which my lord your honour is the last true and thou seest that i no issue have and that my fainting words do warrant death thou art my heir the rest i wish

settled place richard o uncle would some part of my young years might but redeem the passage of your age thou dost then wrong me as that slaughterer doth which giveth many wounds when one will kill mourn not except thou sorrow for my good only give order for my funeral and so farewell and fair be all thy hopes and prosperous be thy life in peace and war dies richard and peace no war befall thy

myself will see his burial better than his life exeunt gaolers bearing out the body of mortimer here dies the dusky torch of mortimer choked with ambition of the meaner sort and for those wrongs those

the battle of patay when but in all i was six thousand strong and that the french were almost ten to one before we met or that a stroke was given like to a trusty squire did run away in which assault we lost twelve hundred men myself and divers gentlemen beside were there surprised and taken prisoners then judge great lords if i have done amiss or whether that such cowards ought to wear this ornament of knighthood yea or no to say the truth this fact was infamous and ill beseeming any common man much more a knight a captain and a leader when first this order was ordain'd my lords knights of the garter were of noble birth valiant and virtuous full of haughty courage such as were grown to credit by the wars not fearing death nor shrinking for distress but always resolute in most extremes he then that is not furnish'd in this sort doth but usurp the sacred name of knight profaning this most honourable order and should if i were worthy to be judge be quite degraded like a hedge

pitiful complaints of such as your oppression feeds upon forsaken your pernicious faction and join'd with charles the rightful king of france o monstrous treachery can this be so that in alliance amity and oaths there should be found such false dissembling guile what doth my uncle burgundy revolt he doth my lord and is become your foe is that the worst this letter doth contain it is the worst and all my lord he writes why then lord talbot there shall talk with him and give him chastisement for this abuse how say you my lord are you not content content my liege yes but that i am prevented i should have begg'd i might have been employ'd then gather strength and march unto him straight let him perceive how ill we brook his treason and what offence it is to flout his friends i go my lord in heart desiring still you may behold confusion of your foes exit enter vernon and basset grant me the combat gracious sovereign and me my lord grant me the combat too this is my servant hear him noble prince and this is mine sweet henry favour him be patient lords and give them leave to speak say gentlemen what makes you thus exclaim and wherefore crave you combat or with whom with him my lord for he hath done me wrong and i with him for he hath done me wrong what is that wrong whereof you both complain first let me know and then i 'll answer you crossing the sea from england into france this fellow here with envious carping tongue upbraided me about the rose i wear saying the sanguine colour of the leaves did represent my master 's blushing cheeks when stubbornly he did repugn the truth about a certain question in the law argued betwixt the duke of york and him with other vile and ignominious terms in confutation of which rude reproach and in defence of my lord 's worthiness i crave the benefit of law of arms and that is my petition noble lord for though he seem with forged quaint conceit to set a gloss upon his bold intent yet know my lord i was provoked by him and he first took exceptions at this badge pronouncing that the paleness of this flower bewray'd the faintness of my master 's heart will not this malice somerset be left your private grudge my lord of york will out though ne'er so cunningly you smother it good lord what madness rules in brainsick men when for so slight and frivolous a cause such factious emulations shall arise good cousins both of york and somerset quiet yourselves i pray and be at peace let this dissension first be tried by fight and then your highness shall command a peace the quarrel toucheth none but us alone betwixt ourselves let us decide it then there is my pledge accept it somerset nay let it rest where it began at first confirm it so mine honourable lord confirm it so confounded be your strife and perish ye with your audacious prate presumptuous vassals are you not ashamed with this immodest clamorous outrage to trouble and disturb the king and us and you my lords methinks you do not well to bear with their perverse objections much less to take occasion from their mouths to raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves let me persuade you take a better course it grieves his highness good my lords be friends come hither you that would be combatants henceforth i charge you as you love our favour quite to forget this quarrel and the cause and you my lords remember where we are in france amongst a fickle wavering nation if they perceive dissension in our looks and that within ourselves we disagree how will their grudging stomachs be provoked to wilful disobedience and rebel beside what infamy will there arise when foreign princes shall be certified that for a toy a thing of no regard king henry 's peers and chief nobility destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of france o think upon the conquest of my father my tender years and let us not forego that for a trifle that was bought with blood let me be umpire in this doubtful strife i see no reason if i wear this rose putting on a red rose that any one should therefore be suspicious i more incline to somerset than york both are my kinsmen and i love them both as well they may upbraid me with my crown because forsooth the king of scots is crown'd but your discretions better can persuade than i am able to instruct or teach and therefore as we hither came in peace so let us still continue peace and love cousin of york we institute your grace to be our regent in these parts of france and good my lord of somerset unite your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot and like true subjects sons of your progenitors go cheerfully together and

have earnestly implored a general peace betwixt our nation and the aspiring french and here at hand the dauphin and his train approacheth to confer about some matter is all our travail turn'd to this effect after the slaughter of so many peers so many captains gentlemen and soldiers that in this quarrel have been overthrown and sold their bodies for their country 's benefit shall we at last conclude effeminate peace have we not lost most part of all the towns by treason falsehood and by treachery our great progenitors had conquered o warwick warwick i foresee with grief the utter loss of all the realm of france be patient york if we conclude a peace it shall be with such strict and severe covenants as little shall the frenchmen gain thereby enter charles alencon bastard of orleans reignier and others since lords of england it is thus agreed that peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in france we come to be informed by yourselves what the conditions of that league must be speak winchester for boiling choler chokes the hollow passage of my poison'd voice by sight of these our baleful enemies cardinal charles and the rest it is enacted thus that in regard king henry gives consent of mere compassion and of lenity to ease your country of distressful war and suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace you shall become true liegemen to his crown and charles upon condition thou wilt swear to pay him tribute submit thyself thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him and still enjoy thy regal dignity must he be then as shadow of himself adorn his temples with a coronet and yet in substance and authority retain but privilege of a private man this proffer is absurd and reasonless tis known already that i am possess'd with more than half the gallian territories and therein reverenced for their lawful king shall i for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd detract so much from that prerogative as to be call'd but viceroy of the whole no lord ambassador i 'll rather keep that which i have than coveting for more be cast from possibility of all insulting charles hast thou by secret means used intercession to obtain a league and now the matter grows to compromise stand'st thou aloof upon comparison either accept the title thou usurp'st of benefit proceeding from our king and not of any challenge of desert or we will plague thee with incessant wars my lord you do not well in obstinacy to cavil in the course of this contract if once it be neglected ten to one we shall not find like opportunity to say the truth it is your policy to save your subjects from such massacre and ruthless slaughters as are daily seen by our proceeding in hostility and therefore take this compact of a truce although you break it when your pleasure serves how say'st thou charles shall our condition stand it shall only reserved you claim no interest in any of our towns of garrison then swear allegiance to his majesty as thou art knight never to disobey nor be rebellious to the crown of england thou nor thy nobles to the crown of england so now dismiss your army when ye please hang up your ensign let your drums be still for here we entertain a solemn peace exeunt scene v. london the palace enter suffolk in conference with king henry vi gloucester and exeter your wondrous rare description noble earl of beauteous margaret hath astonish'd me her virtues graced with external gifts do breed love 's settled passions in my heart and like as rigor of tempestuous gusts provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide so am i driven by breath of her renown either to suffer shipwreck or arrive where i may have fruition of her love tush my good lord this superficial tale is but a preface of her worthy praise the chief perfections of that lovely dame had i sufficient skill to utter them would make a volume of enticing lines able to ravish any dull conceit and which is more she is not so divine so full replete with choice of all delights but with as humble lowliness of mind she is content to be at your command command i mean of virtuous chaste intents to love and honour henry as her lord and otherwise will henry ne'er presume therefore my lord protector give consent that margaret may be england 's royal queen so should i give consent to flatter sin you know my lord your highness is betroth'd unto another lady of esteem how shall we then dispense with that contract and not deface your honour with reproach as doth a ruler with unlawful oaths or one that at a triumph having vow'd to try his strength forsaketh yet the lists by reason of his adversary 's odds a poor earl 's daughter is unequal odds and therefore may be broke without offence why what i pray is margaret more than that her father is no better than an earl although in glorious titles he excel yes lord her father is a king the king of naples and jerusalem and of such great authority in france as his alliance will confirm our peace and keep the frenchmen in allegiance and so the earl of armagnac may do because he is near kinsman unto charles beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower where reignier sooner will receive than give a dower my lords disgrace not so your king that he should be so abject base and poor to choose for wealth and not for perfect love henry is able to enrich his queen and not seek a queen to make him rich so worthless peasants bargain for their wives as market men for oxen sheep or horse marriage is a matter of more worth than to be dealt in by attorneyship not whom we will but whom his grace affects must be companion of his nuptial bed and therefore lords since he affects her most it most of all these reasons bindeth us in our opinions she should be preferr'd for what is wedlock forced but a hell an age of discord and continual strife whereas the contrary bringeth bliss and is a pattern of celestial peace whom should we match with henry being a king but margaret that is daughter to a king her peerless feature joined with her birth approves her fit for none but for a king her valiant courage and undaunted spirit more than in women commonly is seen will answer our hope in issue of a king for henry son unto a conqueror is likely to beget more conquerors if with a lady of so high resolve as is fair margaret he be link'd in love then yield my lords and here conclude with me that margaret shall be queen and none but she whether it be through force of your report my noble lord of suffolk or for that my tender youth was never yet attaint with any passion of inflaming love i can not tell but this i am assured i feel such sharp dissension in my breast such fierce alarums both of hope and fear as i am sick with working of my thoughts take therefore shipping post my lord to france agree to any covenants and procure that lady margaret do vouchsafe to come to cross the seas to england and be crown'd king henry 's faithful and anointed queen for your expenses and sufficient charge among the people gather up a tenth be gone i

and thus he goes as did the youthful paris once to greece with hope to find the like event in love but prosper better than the trojan did margaret shall now be queen and rule the king but i will rule both her the king and realm exit ", "Much Ado about nothing": "act i scene i. before leonato 's house enter leonato hero and beatrice with a messenger i learn in this letter that don peter of arragon comes this night to messina he is very near by this he was not three leagues off when i left him how many gentlemen have you lost in this action but few of any sort and none of name a victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers i find here that don peter hath bestowed much honour on a young florentine called claudio much deserved on his part and equally remembered by don pedro he hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion he hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how he hath an uncle here in messina will be very much glad of it i have already delivered him letters and there appears much joy in him even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness did he break out into tears in great measure a kind overflow of kindness there are no faces truer than those that are so washed how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping i pray you is signior mountanto returned from the wars or no i know none of that name lady there was none such in the army of any sort what is he that you ask for niece my cousin means signior benedick of padua o he 's returned and as pleasant as ever he was he set up his bills here in messina and challenged cupid at the flight and my uncle 's fool reading the challenge subscribed for cupid and challenged him at the bird bolt i pray you how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars but how many hath he killed for indeed i promised to eat all of his killing faith niece you tax signior benedick too much but he 'll be meet with you i doubt it not he hath done good service lady in these wars you had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it he is a very valiant trencherman he hath an excellent stomach and a good soldier too lady and a good soldier to a lady but what is he to a lord a lord to a lord a man to a man stuffed with all honourable virtues it is so indeed he is no less than a stuffed man but for the stuffing,--well we are all mortal you must not sir mistake my niece there is a kind of merry war betwixt signior benedick and her they never meet but there 's a skirmish of wit between them alas he gets nothing by that in our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off and now is the whole man governed with one so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature who is his companion now he hath every month a new sworn brother is't possible very easily possible he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat it ever changes with the next block i see lady the gentleman is not in your books no an he were i would burn my study but i pray you who is his companion is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil he is most in the company of the right noble claudio o lord he will hang upon him like a disease he is sooner caught than the pestilence and the taker runs presently mad god help the noble claudio if he have caught the benedick it will cost him a thousand pound ere a be cured i will hold friends with you lady do good friend you will never run mad niece no not till a hot january don pedro is approached enter don pedro don john claudio benedick and balthasar good signior leonato you are come to meet your trouble the fashion of the world is to avoid cost and you encounter it never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your grace for trouble being gone comfort should remain but when you depart from me sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave you embrace your charge too willingly i think this is your daughter her mother hath many times told me so were you in doubt sir that you asked her signior benedick no for then were you a child you have it full benedick we may guess by this what you are being a man truly the lady fathers herself be happy lady for you are like an honourable father if signior leonato be her father she would not have his head on her shoulders for all messina as like him as she is i wonder that you will still be talking signior benedick nobody marks you what my dear lady disdain are you yet living is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as signior benedick courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence then is courtesy a turncoat but it is certain i am loved of all ladies only you excepted and i would i could find in my heart that i had not a hard heart for truly i love none a dear happiness to women they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor i thank god and my cold blood i am of your humour for that i had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me god keep your ladyship still in that mind so some gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate scratched face scratching could not make it worse an twere such a face as yours were well you are a rare parrot teacher a bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours i would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer but keep your way i god 's name i have done you always end with a jade 's trick i know you of old that is the sum of all leonato signior claudio and signior benedick my dear friend leonato hath invited you all i tell him we shall stay here at the least a month and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer i dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart if you swear my lord you shall not be forsworn to don john let me bid you welcome my lord being reconciled to the prince your brother i owe you all duty i thank you i am not of many words but i thank you please it your grace lead on your hand leonato we will go together exeunt all except benedick and claudio benedick didst thou note the daughter of signior leonato i noted her not but i looked on her is she not a modest young lady do you question me as an honest man should do for my simple true judgment or would you have me speak after my custom as being a professed tyrant to their sex no i pray thee speak in sober judgment why i faith methinks she 's too low for a high praise too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise only this commendation i can afford her that were she other than she is she were unhandsome and being no other but as she is i do not like her thou thinkest i am in sport i pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her would you buy her that you inquire after her can the world buy such a jewel yea and a case to put it into but speak you this with a sad brow or do you play the flouting jack to tell us cupid is a good hare finder and vulcan a rare carpenter come in what key shall a man take you to go in the song in mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever i looked on i can see yet without spectacles and i see no such matter there 's her cousin an she were not possessed with a fury exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of may doth the last of december but i hope you have no intent to turn husband have you i would scarce trust myself though i had sworn the contrary if hero would be my wife is't come to this in faith hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion shall i never see a bachelor of three score again go to i faith an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke wear the print of it and sigh away sundays look don pedro is returned to seek you re enter don pedro what secret hath held you here that you followed not to leonato 's i would your grace would constrain me to tell i charge thee on thy allegiance you hear count claudio i can be secret as a dumb man i would have you think so but on my allegiance mark you this on my allegiance he is in love with who now that is your grace 's part mark how short his answer is;--with hero leonato 's short daughter if this were so so were it uttered like the old tale my lord it is not so nor twas not so but indeed god forbid it should be so if my passion change not shortly god forbid it should be otherwise amen if you love her for the lady is very well worthy you speak this to fetch me in my lord by my troth i speak my thought and in faith my lord i spoke mine and by my two faiths and troths my lord i spoke mine that i love her i feel that she is worthy i know that i neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion that fire can not melt out of me i will die in it at the stake thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty and never could maintain his part but in the force of his will that a woman conceived me i thank her that she brought me up i likewise give her most humble thanks but that i will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick all women shall pardon me because i will not do them the wrong to mistrust any i will do myself the right to trust none and the fine is for the which i may go the finer i will live a bachelor i shall see thee ere i die look pale with love with anger with sickness or with hunger my lord not with love prove that ever i lose more blood with love than i will get again with drinking pick out mine eyes with a ballad maker 's pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind cupid well if ever thou dost fall from this faith thou wilt prove a notable argument if i do hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me and he that hits me let him be clapped on the shoulder and called adam well as time shall try in time the savage bull doth bear the yoke the savage bull may but if ever the sensible benedick bear it pluck off the bull 's horns and set them in my forehead and let me be vilely painted and in such great letters as they write here is good horse to hire let them signify under my sign here you may see benedick the married man if this should ever happen thou wouldst be horn mad nay if cupid have not spent all his quiver in venice thou wilt quake for this shortly i look for an earthquake too then well you temporize with the hours in the meantime good signior benedick repair to leonato 's commend me to him and tell him i will not fail him at supper for indeed he hath made great preparation i have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage and so i commit you-- to the tuition of god from my house if i had it,-- the sixth of july your loving friend benedick nay mock not mock not the body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments and the guards are but slightly basted on neither ere you flout old ends any further examine your conscience and so i leave you exit my liege your highness now may do me good my love is thine to teach teach it but how and thou shalt see how apt it is to learn any hard lesson that may do thee good hath leonato any son my lord no child but hero she 's his only heir dost thou affect her claudio o my lord when you went onward on this ended action i look'd upon her with a soldier 's eye that liked but had a rougher task in hand than to drive liking to the name of love but now i am return'd and that war thoughts have left their places vacant in their rooms come thronging soft and delicate desires all prompting me how fair young hero is saying i liked her ere i went to wars thou wilt be like a lover presently and tire the hearer with a book of words if thou dost love fair hero cherish it and i will break with her and with her father and thou shalt have her was't not to this end that thou began'st to twist so fine a story how sweetly you do minister to love that know love 's grief by his complexion but lest my liking might too sudden seem i would have salved it with a longer treatise what need the bridge much broader than the flood the fairest grant is the necessity look what will serve is fit tis once thou lovest and i will fit thee with the remedy i know we shall have revelling to night i will assume thy part in some disguise and tell fair hero i am claudio and in her bosom i 'll unclasp my heart and take her hearing prisoner with the force and strong encounter of my amorous tale then after to her father will i break and the conclusion is she shall be thine in practise let us put it presently exeunt scene ii a room in leonato 's house enter leonato and antonio meeting how now brother where is my cousin your son hath he provided this music he is very busy about it but brother i can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of are they good as the event stamps them but they have a good cover they show well outward the prince and count claudio walking in a thick pleached alley in mine orchard were thus much overheard by a man of mine the prince discovered to claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance and if he found her accordant he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it hath the fellow any wit that told you this a good sharp fellow i will send for him and question him yourself no no we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself but i will acquaint my daughter withal that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true go you and tell her of it enter attendants cousins you know what you have to do o i cry you mercy friend go you with me and i will use your skill good cousin have a care this busy time exeunt scene iii the same enter don john and conrade what the good year my lord why are you thus out of measure sad there is no measure in the occasion that breeds therefore the sadness is without limit you should hear reason and when i have heard it what blessing brings it if not a present remedy at least a patient sufferance i wonder that thou being as thou sayest thou art born under saturn goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief i can not hide what i am i must be sad when i have cause and smile at no man 's jests eat when i have stomach and wait for no man 's leisure sleep when i am drowsy and tend on no man 's business laugh when i am merry and claw no man in his humour yea but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment you have of late stood out against your brother and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest i had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any in this though i can not be said to be a flattering honest man it must not be denied but i am a plain dealing villain i am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog therefore i have decreed not to sing in my cage if i had my mouth i would bite if i had my liberty i would do my liking in the meantime let me be that i am and seek not to alter me can you make no use of your discontent i make all use of it for i use it only who comes here enter borachio what news borachio i came yonder from a great supper the prince your brother is royally entertained by leonato and i can give you intelligence of an intended marriage will it serve for any model to build mischief on what is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness marry it is your brother 's right hand who the most exquisite claudio even he a proper squire and who and who which way looks he marry on hero the daughter and heir of leonato a very forward march chick how came you to this being entertained for a perfumer as i was smoking a musty room comes me the prince and claudio hand in hand in sad conference i whipt me behind the arras and there heard it agreed upon that the prince should woo hero for himself and having obtained her give her to count claudio come come let us thither this may prove food to my displeasure that young start up hath all the glory of my overthrow if i can cross him any way i bless myself every way you are both sure and will assist me to the death my lord let us to the great supper their cheer is the greater that i am subdued would the cook were of my mind shall we go prove what 's to be done we 'll wait upon your lordship exeunt act ii scene i. a hall in leonato 's house enter leonato antonio hero beatrice and others was not count john here at supper i saw him not how tartly that gentleman looks i never can see him but i am heart burned an hour after he is of a very melancholy disposition he were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and benedick the one is too like an image and says nothing and the other too like my lady 's eldest son evermore tattling then half signior benedick 's tongue in count john 's mouth and half count john 's melancholy in signior benedick 's face,-- with a good leg and a good foot uncle and money enough in his purse such a man would win any woman in the world if a could get her good will by my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue in faith she 's too curst too curst is more than curst i shall lessen god 's sending that way for it is said god sends a curst cow short horns but to a cow too curst he sends none so by being too curst god will send you no horns just if he send me no husband for the which blessing i am at him upon my knees every morning and evening lord i could not endure a husband with a beard on his face i had rather lie in the woollen you may light on a husband that hath no beard what should i do with him dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman he that hath a beard is more than a youth and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that is more than a youth is not for me and he that is less than a man i am not for him therefore i will even take sixpence in earnest of the bear ward and lead his apes into hell well then go you into hell no but to the gate and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and say get you to heaven beatrice get you to heaven here 's no place for you maids so deliver i up my apes and away to saint peter for the heavens he shows me where the bachelors sit and there live we as merry as the day is long to hero   well niece i trust you will be ruled by your father yes faith it is my cousin 's duty to make curtsy and say father as it please you but yet for all that cousin let him be a handsome fellow or else make another curtsy and say father as it please me well niece i hope to see you one day fitted with a husband not till god make men of some other metal than earth would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl no uncle i 'll none adam 's sons are my brethren and truly i hold it a sin to match in my kindred daughter remember what i told you if the prince do solicit you in that kind you know your answer the fault will be in the music cousin if you be not wooed in good time if the prince be too important tell him there is measure in every thing and so dance out the answer for hear me hero wooing wedding and repenting is as a scotch jig a measure and a cinque pace the first suit is hot and hasty like a scotch jig and full as fantastical the wedding mannerly modest as a measure full of state and ancientry and then comes repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinque pace faster and faster till he sink into his grave cousin you apprehend passing shrewdly i have a good eye uncle i can see a church by daylight the revellers are entering brother make good room all put on their masks enter don pedro claudio benedick balthasar don john borachio margaret ursula and others masked lady will you walk about with your friend so you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing i am yours for the walk and especially when i walk away with me in your company i may say so when i please and when please you to say so when i like your favour for god defend the lute should be like the case my visor is philemon 's roof within the house is jove why then your visor should be thatched speak low if you speak love drawing her aside well i would you did like me so would not i for your own sake for i have many ill qualities which is one i say my prayers aloud i love you the better the hearers may cry amen god match me with a good dancer amen and god keep him out of my sight when the dance is done answer clerk no more words the clerk is answered i know you well enough you are signior antonio at a word i am not i know you by the waggling of your head to tell you true i counterfeit him you could never do him so ill well unless you were the very man here 's his dry hand up and down you are he you are he at a word i am not come come do you think i do not know you by your excellent wit can virtue hide itself go to mum you are he graces will appear and there 's an end will you not tell me who told you so no you shall pardon me nor will you not tell me who you are not now that i was disdainful and that i had my good wit out of the hundred merry tales:'--well this was signior benedick that said so what 's he i am sure you know him well enough not i believe me did he never make you laugh i pray you what is he why he is the prince 's jester a very dull fool only his gift is in devising impossible slanders none but libertines delight in him and the commendation is not in his wit but in his villany for he both pleases men and angers them and then they laugh at him and beat him i am sure he is in the fleet i would he had boarded me when i know the gentleman i 'll tell him what you say do do he 'll but break a comparison or two on me which peradventure not marked or not laughed at strikes him into melancholy and then there 's a partridge wing saved for the fool will eat no supper that night music we must follow the leaders in every good thing nay if they lead to any ill i will leave them at the next turning dance then exeunt all except don john borachio and claudio sure my brother is amorous on hero and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it the ladies follow her and but one visor remains and that is claudio i know him by his bearing are not you signior benedick you know me well i am he signior you are very near my brother in his love he is enamoured on hero i pray you dissuade him from her she is no equal for his birth you may do the part of an honest man in it how know you he loves her i heard him swear his affection so did i too and he swore he would marry her to night come let us to the banquet exeunt don john and borachio thus answer i in the name of benedick but hear these ill news with the ears of claudio tis certain so the prince wooes for himself friendship is constant in all other things save in the office and affairs of love therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues let every eye negotiate for itself and trust no agent for beauty is a witch against whose charms faith melteth into blood this is an accident of hourly proof which i mistrusted not farewell therefore hero re enter benedick count claudio yea the same come will you go with me whither even to the next willow about your own business county what fashion will you wear the garland of about your neck like an usurer 's chain or under your arm like a lieutenant 's scarf you must wear it one way for the prince hath got your hero i wish him joy of her why that 's spoken like an honest drovier so they sell bullocks but did you think the prince would have served you thus i pray you leave me ho now you strike like the blind man twas the boy that stole your meat and you 'll beat the post if it will not be i 'll leave you exit alas poor hurt fowl now will he creep into sedges but that my lady beatrice should know me and not know me the prince 's fool ha it may be i go under that title because i am merry yea but so i am apt to do myself wrong i am not so reputed it is the base though bitter disposition of beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out well i 'll be revenged as i may re enter don pedro now signior where 's the count did you see him troth my lord i have played the part of lady fame i found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren i told him and i think i told him true that your grace had got the good will of this young lady and i offered him my company to a willow tree either to make him a garland as being forsaken or to bind him up a rod as being worthy to be whipped to be whipped what 's his fault the flat transgression of a schoolboy who being overjoyed with finding a birds nest shows it his companion and he steals it wilt thou make a trust a transgression the transgression is in the stealer yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made and the garland too for the garland he might have worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on you who as i take it have stolen his birds nest i will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner if their singing answer your saying by my faith you say honestly the lady beatrice hath a quarrel to you the gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you o she misused me past the endurance of a block an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her my very visor began to assume life and scold with her she told me not thinking i had been myself that i was the prince 's jester that i was duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that i stood like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at me she speaks poniards and every word stabs if her breath were as terrible as her terminations there were no living near her she would infect to the north star i would not marry her though she were endowed with all that adam bad left him before he transgressed she would have made hercules have turned spit yea and have cleft his club to make the fire too come talk not of her you shall find her the infernal ate in good apparel i would to god some scholar would conjure her for certainly while she is here a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror and perturbation follows her look here she comes enter claudio beatrice hero and leonato will your grace command me any service to the world 's end i will go on the slightest errand now to the antipodes that you can devise to send me on i will fetch you a tooth picker now from the furthest inch of asia bring you the length of prester john 's foot fetch you a hair off the great cham 's beard do you any embassage to the pigmies rather than hold three words conference with this harpy you have no employment for me none but to desire your good company o god sir here 's a dish i love not i can not endure my lady tongue exit come lady come you have lost the heart of signior benedick indeed my lord he lent it me awhile and i gave him use for it a double heart for his single one marry once before he won it of me with false dice therefore your grace may well say i have lost it you have put him down lady you have put him down so i would not he should do me my lord lest i should prove the mother of fools i have brought count claudio whom you sent me to seek why how now count wherefore are you sad not sad my lord how then sick neither my lord the count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor well but civil count civil as an orange and something of that jealous complexion i faith lady i think your blazon to be true though i 'll be sworn if he be so his conceit is false here claudio i have wooed in thy name and fair hero is won i have broke with her father and his good will obtained name the day of marriage and god give thee joy count take of me my daughter and with her my fortunes his grace hath made the match and an grace say amen to it speak count tis your cue silence is the perfectest herald of joy i were but little happy if i could say how much lady as you are mine i am yours i give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange speak cousin or if you can not stop his mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither in faith lady you have a merry heart yea my lord i thank it poor fool it keeps on the windy side of care my cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart and so she doth cousin good lord for alliance thus goes every one to the world but i and i am sunburnt i may sit in a corner and cry heigh ho for a husband lady beatrice i will get you one i would rather have one of your father 's getting hath your grace ne'er a brother like you your father got excellent husbands if a maid could come by them will you have me lady no my lord unless i might have another for working days your grace is too costly to wear every day but i beseech your grace pardon me i was born to speak all mirth and no matter your silence most offends me and to be merry best becomes you for out of question you were born in a merry hour no sure my lord my mother cried but then there was a star danced and under that was i born cousins god give you joy niece will you look to those things i told you of i cry you mercy uncle by your grace 's pardon exit by my troth a pleasant spirited lady there 's little of the melancholy element in her my lord she is never sad but when she sleeps and not ever sad then for i have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing she can not endure to hear tell of a husband o by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suit she were an excellent wife for benedict o lord my lord if they were but a week married they would talk themselves mad county claudio when mean you to go to church to morrow my lord time goes on crutches till love have all his rites not till monday my dear son which is hence a just seven night and a time too brief too to have all things answer my mind come you shake the head at so long a breathing but i warrant thee claudio the time shall not go dully by us i will in the interim undertake one of hercules labours which is to bring signior benedick and the lady beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with the other i would fain have it a match and i doubt not but to fashion it if you three will but minister such assistance as i shall give you direction my lord i am for you though it cost me ten nights watchings and i my lord and you too gentle hero i will do any modest office my lord to help my cousin to a good husband and benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that i know thus far can i praise him he is of a noble strain of approved valour and confirmed honesty i will teach you how to humour your cousin that she shall fall in love with benedick and i with your two helps will so practise on benedick that in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach he shall fall in love with beatrice if we can do this cupid is no longer an archer hi s glory shall be ours for we are the only love gods go in with me and i will tell you my drift exeunt scene ii the same enter don john and borachio it is so the count claudio shall marry the daughter of leonato yea my lord but i can cross it any bar any cross any impediment will be medicinable to me i am sick in displeasure to him and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine how canst thou cross this marriage not honestly my lord but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me show me briefly how i think i told your lordship a year since how much i am in the favour of margaret the waiting gentlewoman to hero i remember i can at any unseasonable instant of the night appoint her to look out at her lady 's chamber window what life is in that to be the death of this marriage the poison of that lies in you to temper go you to the prince your brother spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned claudio whose estimation do you mightily hold up to a contaminated stale such a one as hero what proof shall i make of that proof enough to misuse the prince to vex claudio to undo hero and kill leonato look you for any other issue only to despite them i will endeavour any thing go then find me a meet hour to draw don pedro and the count claudio alone tell them that you know that hero loves me intend a kind of zeal both to the prince and claudio as,--in love of your brother 's honour who hath made this match and his friend 's reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid,--that you have discovered thus they will scarcely believe this without trial offer them instances which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window hear me call margaret hero hear margaret term me claudio and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding,--for in the meantime i will so fashion the matter that hero shall be absent,--and there shall appear such seeming truth of hero 's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called assurance and all the preparation overthrown grow this to what adverse issue it can i will put it in practise be cunning in the working this and thy fee is a thousand ducats be you constant in the accusation and my cunning shall not shame me i will presently go learn their day of marriage exeunt scene iii leonato 's orchard enter benedick boy enter boy signior in my chamber window lies a book bring it hither to me in the orchard i am here already sir i know that but i would have thee hence and here again exit boy i do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love will after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by failing in love and such a man is claudio i have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabour and the pipe i have known when he would have walked ten mile a foot to see a good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet he was wo nt to speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is he turned orthography his words are a very fantastical banquet just so many strange dishes may i be so converted and see with these eyes i can not tell i think not i will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but i 'll take my oath on it till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a fool one woman is fair yet i am well another is wise yet i am well another virtuous yet i am well but till all graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in my grace rich she shall be that 's certain wise or i 'll none virtuous or i 'll never cheapen her fair or i 'll    never look on

the arbour withdraws enter don pedro claudio and leonato come shall we hear this music yea my good lord how still the evening is as hush'd on purpose to grace harmony see you where benedick hath hid himself o very well my lord the music ended we 'll fit the kid fox with a pennyworth enter balthasar with music come balthasar we 'll hear that song again o good my lord tax not so bad a voice to slander music any more than once it is the witness still of excellency to put a strange face on his own perfection i pray thee sing and let me woo no more because you talk of wooing i will sing since many a wooer doth commence his suit to her he thinks not worthy yet he wooes yet will he swear he loves now pray thee come or if thou wilt hold longer argument do it in notes note this before my notes there 's not a note of mine that 's worth the noting why these are very crotchets that he speaks note notes forsooth and nothing air now divine air now is his soul ravished is it not strange that sheeps guts should hale souls out of men 's bodies well a horn for my money when all 's done the song sigh no more ladies sigh no more men were deceivers ever one foot in sea and one on shore to one thing constant never then sigh not so but let them go and be you blithe and bonny converting all your sounds of woe into hey nonny nonny sing no more ditties sing no moe of dumps so dull and heavy the fraud of men was ever so since summer first was leafy then sigh not so   and c. by my troth a good song and an ill singer my lord ha no no faith thou singest well enough for a shift an he had been a dog that should have howled thus they would have hanged him and i pray god his bad voice bode no mischief i had as lief have heard the night raven come what plague could have come after it yea marry dost thou hear balthasar i pray thee get us some excellent music for to morrow night we would have it at the lady hero 's chamber window the best i can my lord do so farewell exit balthasar come hither leonato what was it you told me of to day that your niece beatrice was in love with signior benedick o ay stalk on stalk on the fowl sits i did never think that lady would have loved any man no nor i neither but most wonderful that she should so dote on signior benedick whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor is't possible sits the wind in that corner by my troth my lord i can not tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection it is past the infinite of thought may be she doth but counterfeit faith like enough o god counterfeit there was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it why what effects of passion shows she bait the hook well this fish will bite what effects my lord she will sit you you heard my daughter tell you how she did indeed how how pray you you amaze me i would have i thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection i would have sworn it had my lord especially against benedick i should think this a gull but that the white bearded fellow speaks it knavery can not sure hide himself in such reverence he hath ta'en the infection hold it up hath she made her affection known to benedick no and swears she never will that 's her torment tis true indeed so your daughter says shall i says she that have so oft encountered him with scorn write to him that i love him this says she now when she is beginning to write to him for she 'll be up twenty times a night and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper my daughter tells us all now you talk of a sheet of paper i remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of o when she had writ it and was reading it over she found benedick and beatrice between the sheet that o she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her i measure him says she by my own spirit for i should flout him if he writ to me yea though i love him i should then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs beats her heart tears her hair prays curses o sweet benedick god give me patience she doth indeed my daughter says so and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage to herself it is very true it were good that benedick knew of it by some other if she will not discover it to what end he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse an he should it were an alms to hang him she 's an excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion she is virtuous and she is exceeding wise in every thing but in loving benedick o my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory i am sorry for her as i have just cause being her uncle and her guardian i would she had bestowed this dotage on me i would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself i pray you tell benedick of it and hear what a will say were it good think you hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness she doth well if she should make tender of her love tis very possible he 'll scorn it for the man as you know all hath a contemptible spirit he is a very proper man he hath indeed a good outward happiness before god and in my mind very wise he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit and i take him to be valiant as hector i assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great discretion or undertakes them with a most christian like fear if he do fear god a must necessarily keep peace if he break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling and so will he do for the man doth fear god howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make well i am sorry for your niece shall we go seek benedick and tell him of her love never tell him my lord let her wear it out with good counsel nay that 's impossible she may wear her heart out first well we will hear further of it by your daughter let it cool the while i love benedick well and i could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady my lord will you walk dinner is ready if he do not dote on her upon this i will never trust my expectation let there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry the sport will be when they hold one an opinion of another 's dotage and no such matter that 's the scene that i would see which will be merely a dumb show let us send her to call him in to dinner exeunt don pedro claudio and leonato coming forward   this can be no trick the conference was sadly borne they have the truth of this from hero they seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have their full bent love me why it must be requited i hear how i am censured they say i will bear myself proudly if i perceive the love come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection i did never think to marry i must not seem proud happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending they say the lady is fair tis a truth i can bear them witness and virtuous tis so i can not reprove it and wise but for loving me by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of her folly for i will be horribly in love with her i may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because i have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter a man loves the meat in his youth that he can not endure in his age shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour no the world must be peopled when i said i would die a bachelor i did not think i should live till i were married here comes beatrice by this day she 's a fair lady i do spy some marks of love in her enter beatrice against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner fair beatrice i thank you for your pains i took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful i would not have come you take pleasure then in the message yea just so much as you may take upon a knife 's point and choke a daw withal you have no stomach signior fare you well exit ha against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner there 's a double meaning in that i took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me that 's as much as to say any pains that i take for you is as easy as thanks if i do not take pity of her i am a villain if i do not love her i am a jew i will go get her picture exit act iii scene i. leonato 's garden enter hero margaret and ursula good margaret run thee to the parlor there shalt thou find my cousin beatrice proposing with the prince and claudio whisper her ear and tell her i and ursula walk in the orchard and our whole discourse is all of her say that thou overheard'st us and bid her steal into the pleached bower where honeysuckles ripen'd by the sun forbid the sun to enter like favourites made proud by princes that advance their pride against that power that bred it there will she hide her to listen our purpose   this is thy office bear thee well in it and leave us alone i 'll make her come i warrant you presently exit now ursula when beatrice doth come as we do trace this alley up and down our talk must only be of benedick when i do name him let it be thy part to praise him more than ever man did merit my talk to thee must be how benedick is sick in love with beatrice of this matter is little cupid 's crafty arrow made that only wounds by hearsay enter beatrice behind now begin for look where beatrice like a lapwing runs close by the ground to hear our conference the pleasant'st angling is to see the fish cut with her golden oars the silver stream and greedily devour the treacherous bait so angle we for beatrice who even now is couched in the woodbine coverture fear you not my part of the dialogue then go we near her that her ear lose nothing of the false sweet bait that we lay for it approaching the bower no truly ursula she is too disdainful i know her spirits are as coy and wild as haggerds of the rock but are you sure that benedick loves beatrice so entirely so says the prince and my new trothed lord and did they bid you tell her of it madam they did entreat me to acquaint her of it but i persuaded them if they loved benedick to wish him wrestle with affection and never to let beatrice know of it why did you so doth not the gentleman deserve as full as fortunate a bed as ever beatrice shall couch upon o god of love i know he doth deserve as much as may be yielded to a man but nature never framed a woman 's heart of prouder stuff than that of beatrice disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes misprising what they look on and her wit values itself so highly that to her all matter else seems weak she can not love nor take no shape nor project of affection she is so self endeared sure i think so and therefore certainly it were not good she knew his love lest she make sport at it why you speak truth i never yet saw man how wise how noble young how rarely featured but she would spell him backward if fair faced she would swear the gentleman should be her sister if black why nature drawing of an antique made a foul blot if tall a lance ill headed if low an agate very vilely cut if speaking why a vane blown with all winds if silent why a block moved with none so turns she every man the wrong side out and never gives to truth and virtue that which simpleness and merit purchaseth sure sure such carping is not commendable no not to be so odd and from all fashions as beatrice is can not be commendable but who dare tell her so if i should speak she would mock me into air o she would laugh me out of myself press me to death with wit therefore let benedick like cover'd fire consume away in sighs waste inwardly it were a better death than die with mocks which is as bad as die with tickling yet tell her of it hear what she will say no rather i will go to benedick and counsel him to fight against his passion and truly i 'll devise some honest slanders to stain my cousin with one doth not know how much an ill word may empoison liking o do not do your cousin such a wrong she can not be so much without true judgment-- having so swift and excellent a wit as she is prized to have as to refuse so rare a gentleman as signior benedick he is the only man of italy always excepted my dear claudio i pray you be not angry with me madam speaking my fancy signior benedick for shape for bearing argument and valour goes foremost in report through italy indeed he hath an excellent good name his excellence did earn it ere he had it when are you married madam why every day to morrow come go in i 'll show thee some attires and have thy counsel which is the best to furnish me to morrow she 's limed i warrant you we have caught her madam if it proves so then loving goes by haps some cupid kills with arrows some with traps exeunt hero and ursula coming forward what fire is in mine ears can this be true stand i condemn'd for pride and scorn so much contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu no glory lives behind the back of such and benedick love on i will requite thee taming my wild heart to thy loving hand if thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee to bind our loves up in a holy band for others say thou dost deserve and i believe it better than reportingly exit scene ii a room in leonato 's house enter don pedro claudio benedick and leonato i do but stay till your marriage be consummate and then go i toward arragon i 'll bring you thither my lord if you 'll vouchsafe me nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it i will only be bold with benedick for his company for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth he hath twice or thrice cut cupid 's bow string and the little hangman dare not shoot at him he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks gallants i am not as i have been so say i \t methinks you are sadder i hope he be in love hang him truant there 's no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love if he be sad he wants money i have the toothache draw it hang it you must hang it first and draw it afterwards what sigh for the toothache where is but a humour or a worm well every one can master a grief but he that has it yet say i he is in love there is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises as to be a dutchman today a frenchman to morrow or in the shape of two countries at once as a german from the waist downward all slops and a spaniard from the hip upward no doublet unless he have a fancy to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no fool for fancy as you would have it appear he is if he be not in love with some woman there is no believing old signs a brushes his hat o mornings what should that bode hath any man seen him at the barber 's no but the barber 's man hath been seen with him and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard nay a rubs himself with civet can you smell him out by that that 's as much as to say the sweet youth 's in love the greatest note of it is his melancholy and when was he wo nt to wash his face yea or to paint himself for the which i hear what they say of him nay but his jesting spirit which is now crept into a lute string and now governed by stops indeed that tells a heavy tale for him conclude conclude he is in love nay but i know who loves him that would i know too i warrant one that knows him not yes and his ill conditions and in despite of all dies for him she shall be buried with her face upwards yet is this no charm for the toothache old signior walk aside with me i have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you which these hobby horses must not hear exeunt benedick and leonato for my life to break with him about beatrice tis even so hero and margaret have by this played their parts with beatrice and then the two bears will not bite one another when they meet enter don john my lord and brother god save you good den brother if your leisure served i would speak with you in private if it please you yet count claudio may hear for what i would speak of concerns him what 's the matter to claudio   means your lordship to be married to morrow you know he does i know not that when he knows what i know if there be any impediment i pray you discover it you may think i love you not let that appear hereafter and aim better at me by that i now will manifest for my brother i think he holds you well and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage;--surely suit ill spent and labour ill bestowed why what 's the matter i came hither to tell you and circumstances shortened for she has been too long a talking of the lady is disloyal who hero even she leonato 's hero your hero every man 's hero disloyal the word is too good to paint out her wickedness i could say she were worse think you of a worse title and i will fit her to it wonder not till further warrant go but with me to night you shall see her chamber window entered even the night before her wedding day if you love her then to morrow we d her but it would better fit your honour to change your mind may this be so i will not think it if you dare not trust that you see confess not that you know if you will follow me i will show you enough and when you have seen more and heard more proceed accordingly if i see any thing to night why i should not marry her to morrow in the congregation where i should we d there will i shame her and as i wooed for thee to obtain her i will join with thee to disgrace her i will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself o day untowardly turned o mischief strangely thwarting o plague right well prevented so will you say when you have seen the sequel exeunt scene iii a street enter dogberry and verges with the watch are you good men and true yea or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation body and soul nay that were a punishment too good for them if they should have any allegiance in them being chosen for the prince 's watch well give them their charge neighbour dogberry first who think you the most desertless man to be constable hugh otecake sir or george seacole for they can write and read come hither neighbour seacole god hath blessed you with a good name to be a well favoured man is the gift of fortune but to write and read comes by nature both which master constable,-- you have i knew it would be your answer well for your favour sir why give god thanks and make no boast of it and for your writing and reading let that appear when there is no need of such vanity you are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch therefore bear you the lantern this is your charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are to bid any man stand in the prince 's name how if a will not stand why then take no note of him but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank god you are rid of a knave if he will not stand when he is bidden he is none of the prince 's subjects true and they are to meddle with none but the prince 's subjects you shall also make no noise in the streets for for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured we will rather sleep than talk we know what belongs to a watch why you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman for i can not see how sleeping should offend only have a care that your bills be not stolen well you are to call at all the ale houses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed how if they will not why then let them alone till they are sober if they make you not then the better answer you may say they are not the men you took them for well sir if you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue of your office to be no true man and for such kind of men the less you meddle or make with them why the more is for your honesty if we know him to be a thief shall we not lay hands on him truly by your office you may but i think they that touch pitch will be defiled the most peaceable way for you if you do take a thief is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company you have been always called a merciful man partner truly i would not hang a dog by my will much more a man who hath any honesty in him if you hear a child cry in the night you must call to the nurse and bid her still it how if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us why then depart in peace and let the child wake her with crying for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats tis very true this is the end of the charge:--you constable are to present the prince 's own person if you meet the prince in the night you may stay him nay by'r our lady that i think a can not five shillings to one on't with any man that knows the statutes he may stay him marry not without the prince be willing for indeed the watch ought to offend no man and it is an offence to stay a man against his will by'r lady i think it be so ha ha ha well masters good night an there be any matter of weight chances call up me keep your fellows counsels and your own and good night come neighbour well masters we hear our charge let us go sit here upon the church bench till two and then all to bed one word more honest neighbours i pray you watch about signior leonato 's door for the wedding being there to morrow there is a great coil to night adieu be vigitant i beseech you exeunt dogberry and verges enter borachio and conrade what conrade aside   peace stir not conrade i say here man i am at thy elbow mass and my elbow itched i thought there would a scab follow i will owe thee an answer for that and now forward with thy tale stand thee close then under this pent house for it drizzles rain and i will like a true drunkard utter all to thee aside   some treason masters yet stand close therefore know i have earned of don john a thousand ducats is it possible that any villany should be so dear thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villany should be so rich for when rich villains have need of poor ones poor ones may make what price they will i wonder at it that shows thou art unconfirmed thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet or a hat or a cloak is nothing to a man yes it is apparel i mean the fashion yes the fashion is the fashion tush i may as well say the fool 's the fool but seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is aside   i know that deformed a has been a vile thief this seven year a goes up and down like a gentleman i remember his name didst thou not hear somebody no twas the vane on the house seest thou not i say what a deformed thief this fashion is how giddily a turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and five and thirty sometimes fashioning them like pharaoh 's soldiers in the reeky painting sometime like god bel 's priests in the old church window sometime like the shaven hercules in the smirched worm eaten tapestry where his codpiece seems as massy as his club all this i see and i see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man but art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion not so neither but know that i have to night wooed margaret the lady hero 's gentlewoman by the name of hero she leans me out at her mistress chamber window bids me a thousand times good night,--i tell this tale vilely:--i should first tell thee how the prince claudio and my master planted and placed and possessed by my master don john saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter and thought they margaret was hero two of them did the prince and claudio but the devil my master knew she was margaret and partly by his oaths which first possessed them partly by the dark night which did deceive them but chiefly by my villany which did confirm any slander that don john had made away went claudio enraged swore he would meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple and there before the whole congregation shame her with what he saw o'er night and send her home again without a husband we charge you in the prince 's name stand call up the right master constable we have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth and one deformed is one of them i know him a wears a lock masters masters,-- you 'll be made bring deformed forth i warrant you masters,-- never speak we charge you let us obey you to go with us we are like to prove a goodly commodity being taken up of these men 's bills a commodity in question i warrant you come we 'll obey you exeunt scene iv hero 's apartment

like a maid she blushes here o what authority and show of truth can cunning sin cover itself withal comes not that blood as modest evidence to witness simple virtue would you not swear all you that see her that she were a maid by these exterior shows but she is none she knows the heat of a luxurious bed her blush is guiltiness not modesty what do you mean my lord not to be married not to knit my soul to an approved wanton dear my lord if you in your own proof have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth and made defeat of her virginity,-- i know what you would say if i have known her you will say she did embrace me as a husband and so extenuate the forehand sin no leonato i never tempted her with word too large but as a brother to his sister show'd bashful sincerity and comely love and seem'd i ever otherwise to you out on thee seeming i will write against it you seem to me as dian in her orb as chaste as is the bud ere it be blown but you are more intemperate in your blood than venus or those pamper'd animals that rage in savage sensuality is my lord well that he doth speak so wide sweet prince why speak not you what should i speak i stand dishonour'd that have gone about to

did see her hear her at that hour last night talk with a ruffian at her chamber window who hath indeed most like a liberal villain confess'd the vile encounters they have had a thousand times in secret fie fie they are not to be named my lord not to be spoke of there is not chastity enough in language without offence to utter them thus pretty lady i am sorry for thy much misgovernment o hero what a hero hadst thou been if half thy outward graces had been placed about thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart but fare thee well most foul most fair farewell thou pure impiety and impious purity for thee i 'll lock up all the gates of love and on my eyelids shall conjecture hang to turn all beauty into thoughts of harm and never shall it more be gracious hath no man 's dagger here a point for me hero swoons why how now cousin wherefore sink you down come let us go these things come thus to light smother her spirits up exeunt don pedro don john and claudio how doth the lady dead i think help uncle hero why hero uncle signior benedick friar o fate take not away thy heavy hand death is the fairest cover for her shame that may be wish'd for how now cousin hero have comfort lady dost thou look up yea wherefore should she not wherefore why doth not every earthly thing cry shame upon her could she here deny the story that is printed in her blood do not live hero do not ope thine eyes for did i think thou wouldst not quickly die thought i thy spirits were stronger than thy shames myself would on the rearward of reproaches strike at thy life grieved i i had but one chid i for that at frugal nature 's frame o one too much by thee why had i one why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes why had i not with charitable hand took up a beggar 's issue at my gates who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy i might have said no part of it is mine this shame derives itself from unknown loins but mine and mine i loved and mine i praised and mine that i was proud on mine so much that i myself was to myself not mine valuing of her,--why she o she is fallen into a pit of ink that the wide sea hath drops too few to wash her clean again and salt too little which may season give to her foul tainted flesh sir sir be patient for my part i am so attired in wonder i know not what to say o on my soul my cousin is belied lady were you her bedfellow last night no truly not although until last night i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow confirm'd confirm'd o that is stronger made which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron would the two princes lie and claudio lie who loved her so that speaking of her foulness wash'd it with tears hence from her let her die hear me a little for i have only been silent so long and given way unto this course of fortune by noting of the lady i have mark'd a thousand blushing apparitions to start into her face a thousand innocent shames in angel whiteness beat away those blushes and in her eye there hath appear'd a fire to burn the errors that these princes hold against her maiden truth call me a fool trust not my reading nor my observations which with experimental seal doth warrant the tenor of my book trust not my age my reverence calling nor divinity if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here under some biting error friar it can not be thou seest that all the grace that she hath left is that she will not add to her damnation a sin of perjury she not denies it why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse that which appears in proper nakedness lady what man is he you are accused of they know that do accuse me i know none if i know more of any man alive than that which maiden modesty doth warrant let all my sins lack mercy o my father prove you that any man with me conversed at hours unmeet or that i yesternight maintain'd the change of words with any creature refuse me hate me torture me to death there is some strange misprision in the princes two of them have the very bent of honour and if their wisdoms be misled in this the practise of it lives in john the bastard whose spirits toil in frame of villanies i know not if they speak but truth of her these hands shall tear her if they wrong her honour the proudest of them shall well hear of it time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine nor age so eat up my invention nor fortune made such havoc of my means nor my bad life reft me so much of friends but they shall find awaked in such a kind both strength of limb and policy of mind ability in means and choice of friends to quit me of them throughly pause awhile and let my counsel sway you in this case your daughter here the princes left for dead let her awhile be secretly kept in and publish it that she is dead indeed maintain a mourning ostentation and on your family 's old monument hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites that appertain unto a burial what shall become of this what will this do marry this well carried shall on her behalf change slander to remorse that is some good but not for that dream i on this strange course but on this travail look for greater birth she dying as it must so be maintain'd upon the instant that she was accused shall be lamented pitied and excused of every hearer for it so falls out that what we have we prize not to the worth whiles we enjoy it but being lack'd and lost why then we rack the value then we find the virtue that possession would not show us whiles it was ours so will it fare with claudio when he shall hear she died upon his words the idea of her life shall sweetly creep into his study of imagination and every lovely organ of her life shall come apparell'd in more precious habit more moving delicate and full of life into the eye and prospect of his soul than when she lived indeed then shall he mourn if ever love had interest in his liver and wish he had not so accused her no though he thought his accusation true let this be so and doubt not but success will fashion the event in better shape than i can lay it down in likelihood but if all aim but this be levell'd false the supposition of the lady 's death will quench the wonder of her infamy and if it sort not well you may conceal her as best befits her wounded reputation in some reclusive and religious life out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries signior leonato let the friar advise you and though you know my inwardness and love is very much unto the prince and claudio yet by mine honour i will deal in this as secretly and justly as your soul should with your body being that i flow in grief the smallest twine may lead me tis well consented presently away for to strange sores strangely they strain the cure come lady die to live this wedding day perhaps is but prolong'd have patience and endure exeunt all but benedick and beatrice lady beatrice have you wept all this while yea and i will weep a while longer i will not desire that you have no reason i do it freely surely i do believe your fair cousin is wronged ah how much might the man deserve of me

i am gone though i am here there is no love in you nay i pray you let me go beatrice,-- in faith i will go we 'll be friends first you dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy is claudio thine enemy is he not approved in the height a villain that hath slandered scorned dishonoured my kinswoman o that i were a man what bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then with public accusation uncovered slander unmitigated rancour --o god that i were a man i would eat his heart in the market place hear me beatrice,-- talk with a man out at a window a proper saying nay but beatrice,-- sweet hero she is wronged she is slandered she is undone beat-- princes and counties surely a princely testimony a goodly count count comfect a sweet gallant surely o that i were a man for his sake or that i had any friend would be a man for my sake but manhood is melted into courtesies valour into compliment and men are only turned into tongue and trim ones too he is now as valiant as hercules that only tells a lie and swears it i can not be a man with wishing therefore i will die a woman with grieving tarry good beatrice by this hand i love thee use it for my love some other way than swearing by it think you in your soul the count claudio hath wronged hero yea as sure as i have a thought or a soul enough i am engaged i will challenge him i will kiss your hand and so i

act v scene i. before leonato 's house enter leonato and antonio if you go on thus you will kill yourself and tis not wisdom thus to second grief against yourself i pray thee cease thy counsel which falls into mine ears as profitless as water in a sieve give not me counsel nor let no comforter delight mine ear but such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine bring me a father that so loved his child whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine and bid him speak of patience measure his woe the length and breadth of mine and let it answer every strain for strain as thus for thus and such a grief for such in every lineament branch shape and form if such a one will smile and stroke his beard bid sorrow wag cry hem when he should groan patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk with candle wasters bring him yet to me and i of him will gather patience but there is no such man for brother men can counsel and speak comfort to that grief which they themselves not feel but tasting it their counsel turns to passion which before would give preceptial medicine to rage fetter strong madness in a silken thread charm ache with air and agony with words no no tis all men 's office to speak patience to those that wring under the load of sorrow but no man 's virtue nor sufficiency to be so moral when he shall endure the like himself therefore give me no counsel my griefs cry louder than advertisement therein do men from children nothing differ i pray thee peace i will be flesh and blood for there was never yet philosopher that could endure the toothache patiently however they have writ the style of gods and made a push at chance and sufferance yet bend not all the harm upon yourself make those that do offend you suffer too there thou speak'st reason nay i will do so my soul

on tuesday morning there 's a double tongue there 's two tongues thus did she an hour together transshape thy particular virtues yet at last she concluded with a sigh thou wast the properest man in italy for the which she wept heartily and said she cared not yea that she did but yet for all that an if she did not hate him deadly she would love him dearly the old man 's daughter told us all all all and moreover god saw him when he was hid in the garden but when shall we set the savage bull 's horns on the sensible benedick 's head yea and text underneath here dwells benedick the married man

overheard me confessing to this man how don john your brother incensed me to slander the lady hero how you were brought into the orchard and saw me court margaret in hero 's garments how you disgraced her when you should marry her my villany they have upon record which i had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame the lady is dead upon mine and my master 's false accusation and briefly i desire nothing but the reward of a villain runs not this speech like iron through your blood i have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it but did my brother set thee on to this yea and paid me

bend under any heavy weight that he 'll enjoin me to i can not bid you bid my daughter live that were impossible but i pray you both possess the people in messina here how innocent she died and if your love can labour ought in sad invention hang her an epitaph upon her tomb and sing it to her bones sing it to night to morrow morning come you to my house and since you could not be my son in law

pray thee sweet mistress margaret deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of beatrice will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty in so high a style margaret that no man living shall come over it for in most comely truth thou deservest it to have no man come over me why shall i always keep below stairs thy wit is as quick as the greyhound 's mouth it catches and yours as blunt as the fencer 's foils which hit but hurt not a most manly wit margaret it will not hurt a woman and so i pray thee call beatrice i give thee the bucklers give us the swords we have bucklers of our own if you use them margaret you must put in the pikes with a vice and they are dangerous weapons for maids well i will call beatrice to you who i think hath legs and therefore will come exit margaret sings the god of love that sits above and knows me and knows me how pitiful i deserve,-- i mean in singing but in loving leander the good swimmer troilus the first employer of panders and a whole bookful of these quondam carpet mangers whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank verse why they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self in love marry i can not show it in rhyme i have tried i can find out no rhyme to lady but baby an innocent rhyme for scorn horn a hard rhyme for school fool a babbling rhyme very ominous endings no i was not born under a rhyming planet nor i can not woo in festival terms enter beatrice sweet beatrice wouldst thou come when i called thee yea signior and depart when you bid me o stay but till then then is spoken fare you well now and yet ere i go let me go with that i came which is with knowing what hath passed between you and claudio only foul words and thereupon i will kiss thee foul words is but foul wind and foul wind is but foul breath and foul breath is noisome therefore i will depart unkissed thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense so forcible is thy wit but i must tell thee plainly claudio undergoes my challenge and either i must shortly hear from him or i will subscribe him a coward and i pray thee now tell me for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me for them all together which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them but for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me suffer love a good epithet i do suffer love indeed for i love thee against my will in spite of your heart i think alas poor heart if you spite it for my sake i will spite it for yours for i will never love that which my friend hates thou and i are too wise to woo peaceably it appears not in this confession there 's not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself an old an old instance beatrice that lived in the lime of good neighbours if a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps and how long is that think you question why an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum therefore is it most expedient for the wise if don worm his conscience find no impediment to the contrary to be the trumpet of his own virtues as i am to myself so much for praising myself who i myself will bear witness is praiseworthy and now tell me how doth your cousin very ill and how do you very ill too serve god love me and mend there will i leave you too for here comes one in haste enter ursula madam you must come to your uncle yonder 's old coil at home it is proved my lady hero hath been falsely accused the prince and claudio

prince and claudio who accused her upon the error that you heard debated but margaret was in some fault for this although against her will as it appears in the true course of all the question well i am glad that all things sort so well and so am i being else by faith enforced to call young claudio to a reckoning for it well daughter and you gentle women all withdraw into a chamber by yourselves and when i send for you come hither mask'd exeunt ladies the prince and claudio promised by this hour to visit me you know your office brother you must be father to your brother 's daughter and give

your niece regards me with an eye of favour that eye my daughter lent her tis most true and i do with an eye of love requite her the sight whereof i think you had from me from claudio and the prince but what 's your will your answer sir is enigmatical but for my will my will is your good will may stand with ours this day to be conjoin'd in the state of honourable marriage in which good friar i shall desire your help my heart is with your liking and my help here comes the prince and claudio enter don pedro and claudio and two or three others good morrow to this fair assembly good morrow prince good morrow claudio we here attend you are you yet determined to day to marry with my brother 's daughter i 'll hold my mind were she an ethiope call her forth brother here 's the friar ready exit antonio good morrow benedick why what 's the matter that you have such a february face so full of frost of storm and cloudiness i think he thinks upon the savage bull tush fear not man we 'll tip thy horns with gold and all europa shall rejoice at thee as once europa did at lusty jove when he would play the noble beast in love bull jove sir had an amiable low and some such strange bull leap'd your father 's cow and got a calf in that same noble feat much like to you for you have just his bleat for this i owe you here comes other reckonings re enter antonio with the ladies masked which is the lady i must seize upon this same is she and i do give you her why then she 's mine sweet let me see your face no that you shall not till you take her hand before this friar and swear to marry her give me your hand before this holy friar i am your husband if you like of me and when i lived i was your other wife unmasking and when you loved you were my other husband another hero nothing certainer one hero died defiled but i do live and surely as i live i am a maid the former hero hero that is dead she died my lord but whiles her slander lived all this amazement can i qualify when after that the holy rites are ended i 'll tell you largely of fair hero 's death meantime let wonder seem familiar and to the chapel let us presently soft and fair friar which is beatrice unmasking   i answer to that name what is your will do not you love me why no no more than reason why then your uncle and the prince and claudio have been deceived they swore you did do not you love me troth no no more than reason why then my cousin margaret and ursula are much deceived for they did swear you did they swore that you were almost sick for me they swore that you were well nigh dead for me tis no such matter then you do not love me no truly but in friendly recompense come cousin i am sure you love the gentleman and i 'll be sworn upon't that he loves her for here 's a paper written in his hand a halting sonnet of his own pure brain fashion'd to beatrice and here 's another writ in my cousin 's hand stolen from her pocket containing her affection unto benedick a miracle here 's our own hands against our hearts come i will have thee but by this light i take thee for pity i would not deny you but by this good day i yield upon great persuasion and partly to save your life for i was told you were in a consumption peace i will stop your mouth kissing her how dost thou benedick the married man i 'll tell thee what prince a college of wit crackers can not flout me out of my humour dost thou think i   care for a satire or an epigram no if a man will be beaten with brains a shall wear nothing handsome about him in brief since i do purpose to marry i will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it and therefore never flout at me for what i have said against it for man is a giddy thing and this is my conclusion for thy part claudio i did think to have

humble patience pray gently to hear kindly to judge our play exit scene i. london an ante chamber in the king 's palace enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of ely my lord i 'll tell you that self bill is urged which in the eleventh year of the last king 's reign was like and had indeed against us pass'd but that the scambling and unquiet time did push it out of farther question but how my lord shall we resist it now it must be thought on if it pass against us we lose the better half of our possession for all the temporal lands which men devout by testament have given to the church would they strip from us being valued thus as much as would maintain to the king 's honour full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights six thousand and two hundred good esquires and to relief of lazars and weak age of indigent faint souls past corporal toil a hundred almshouses right well supplied and to the coffers of the king beside a thousand pounds by the year thus runs the bill this would drink deep twould drink the cup and all but what prevention the king is full of grace and fair regard and a true lover of the holy church the courses of his youth promised it not the breath no sooner left his father 's body but that his wildness mortified in him seem'd to die too yea at that very moment consideration like an angel came and whipp'd the offending adam out of him leaving his body as a paradise to envelop and contain celestial spirits never was such a sudden scholar made never came reformation in a flood with such a heady currance scouring faults nor never hydra headed wilfulness so soon did lose his seat and all at once as in this king we are blessed in the change hear him but reason in divinity and all admiring with an inward wish you would desire the king were made a prelate hear him debate of commonwealth affairs you would say it hath been all in all his study list his discourse of war and you shall hear a fearful battle render'd you in music turn him to any cause of policy the gordian knot of it he will unloose familiar as his garter that when he speaks the air a charter'd libertine is still and the mute wonder lurketh in men 's ears to steal his sweet and honey'd sentences so that the art and practic part of life must be the mistress to this theoric which is a wonder how his grace should glean it since his addiction was to courses vain his companies unletter'd rude and shallow his hours fill'd up with riots banquets sports and never noted in him any study any retirement any sequestration from open haunts and popularity the strawberry grows underneath the nettle and wholesome berries thrive and ripen best neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality and so the prince obscured his contemplation under the veil of wildness which no doubt grew like the summer grass fastest by night unseen yet crescive in his faculty it must be so for miracles are ceased and therefore we must needs admit the means how things are perfected but my good lord how now for mitigation of this bill urged by the commons doth his majesty incline to it or no he seems indifferent or rather swaying more upon our part than cherishing the exhibiters against us for i have made an offer to his majesty upon our spiritual convocation and in regard of causes now in hand which i have open'd to his grace at large as touching france to give a greater sum than ever at one time the clergy yet did to his predecessors part withal how did this offer seem received my lord with good acceptance of his majesty save that there was not time enough to hear as i perceived his grace would fain have done the severals and unhidden passages of his true titles to some certain dukedoms and generally to the crown and seat of france derived from edward his great grandfather what was the impediment that broke this off the french ambassador upon that instant craved audience and the hour i think is come to give him hearing is it four o'clock it is then go we in to know his embassy which i could with a ready guess declare before the frenchman speak a word of it i 'll wait upon you and i long to hear it exeunt scene ii the same the presence chamber enter king henry v gloucester bedford exeter warwick westmoreland and attendants where is my gracious lord of canterbury not here in presence send for him good uncle shall we call in the ambassador my liege not yet my cousin we would be resolved before we hear him of some things of weight that task our thoughts concerning us and france enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of ely god and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it sure we thank you my learned lord we pray you to proceed and justly and religiously unfold why the law salique that they have in france or should or should not bar us in our claim and god forbid my dear and faithful lord that you should fashion wrest or bow your reading or nicely charge your understanding soul with opening titles miscreate whose right suits not in native colours with the truth for god doth know how many now in health shall drop their blood in approbation of what your reverence shall incite us to therefore take heed how you impawn our person how you awake our sleeping sword of war we charge you in the name of god take heed for never two such kingdoms did contend without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops are every one a woe a sore complaint gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords that make such waste in brief mortality under this conjuration speak my lord for we will hear note and believe in heart that what you speak is in your conscience wash'd as pure as sin with baptism then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers that owe yourselves your lives and services to this imperial throne there is no bar to make against your highness claim to france but this which they produce from pharamond in terram salicam mulieres ne succedant no woman shall succeed in salique land which salique land the french unjustly gloze to be the realm of france and pharamond the founder of this law and female bar yet their own authors faithfully affirm that the land salique is in germany between the floods of sala and of elbe where charles the great having subdued the saxons there left behind and settled certain french who holding in disdain the german women for some dishonest manners of their life establish'd then this law to wit no female should be inheritrix in salique land which salique as i said twixt elbe and sala is at this day in germany call'd meisen then doth it well appear that salique law was not devised for the realm of france nor did the french possess the salique land until four hundred one and twenty years after defunction of king pharamond idly supposed the founder of this law who died within the year of our redemption four hundred twenty six and charles the great subdued the saxons and did seat the french beyond the river sala in the year eight hundred five besides their writers say king pepin which deposed childeric did as heir general being descended of blithild which was daughter to king clothair make claim and title to the crown of france hugh capet also who usurped the crown of charles the duke of lorraine sole heir male of the true line and stock of charles the great to find his title with some shows of truth through in pure truth it was corrupt and naught convey'd himself as heir to the lady lingare daughter to charlemain who was the son to lewis the emperor and lewis the son of charles the great also king lewis the tenth who was sole heir to the usurper capet could not keep quiet in his conscience wearing the crown of france till satisfied that fair queen isabel his grandmother was lineal of the lady ermengare daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorraine by the which marriage the line of charles the great was re united to the crown of france so that as clear as is the summer 's sun king pepin 's title and hugh capet 's claim king lewis his satisfaction all appear to hold in right and title of the female so do the kings of france unto this day howbeit they would hold up this salique law to bar your highness claiming from the female and rather choose to hide them in a net than amply to imbar their crooked titles usurp'd from you and your progenitors may i with right and conscience make this claim the sin upon my head dread sovereign for in the book of numbers is it writ when the man dies let the inheritance descend unto the daughter gracious lord stand for your own unwind your bloody flag look back into your mighty ancestors go my dread lord to your great grandsire 's tomb from whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit and your great uncle 's edward the black prince who on the french ground play'd a tragedy making defeat on the full power of france whiles his most mighty father on a hill stood smiling to behold his lion 's whelp forage in blood of french nobility o noble english that could entertain with half their forces the full pride of france and let another half stand laughing by all out of work and cold for action awake remembrance of these valiant dead and with your puissant arm renew their feats you are their heir you sit upon their throne the blood and courage that renowned them runs in your veins and my thrice puissant liege is in the very may morn of his youth ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises your brother kings and monarchs of the earth do all expect that you should rouse yourself as did the former lions of your blood they know your grace hath cause and means and might so hath your highness never king of england had nobles richer and more loyal subjects whose hearts have left their bodies here in england and lie pavilion'd in the fields of france o let their bodies follow my dear liege with blood and sword and fire to win your right in aid whereof we of the spiritualty will raise your highness such a mighty sum as never did the clergy at one time bring in to any of your ancestors we must not only arm to invade the french but lay down our proportions to defend against the scot who will make road upon us with all advantages they of those marches gracious sovereign shall be a wall sufficient to defend our inland from the pilfering borderers we do not mean the coursing snatchers only but fear the main intendment of the scot who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us for you shall read that my great grandfather never went with his forces into france but that the scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom came pouring like the tide into a breach with ample and brim fulness of his force galling the gleaned land with hot assays girding with grievous siege castles and towns that england being empty of defence hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood she hath been then more fear'd than harm'd my liege for hear her but exampled by herself when all her chivalry hath been in france and she a mourning widow of her nobles she hath herself not only well defended but taken and impounded as a stray the king of scots whom she did send to france to fill king edward 's fame with prisoner kings and make her chronicle as rich with praise as is the ooze and bottom of the sea with sunken wreck and sunless treasuries but there 's a saying very old and true if that you will france win then with scotland first begin for once the eagle england being in prey to her unguarded nest the weasel scot comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs playing the mouse in absence of the cat to tear and havoc more than she can eat it follows then the cat must stay at home yet that is but a crush'd necessity since we have locks to safeguard necessaries and pretty traps to catch the petty thieves while that the armed hand doth fight abroad the advised head defends itself at home for government though high and low and lower put into parts doth keep in one consent congreeing in a full and natural close like music therefore doth heaven divide the state of man in divers functions setting endeavour in continual motion to which is fixed as an aim or butt obedience for so work the honey bees creatures that by a rule in nature teach the act of order to a peopled kingdom they have a king and officers of sorts where some like magistrates correct at home others like merchants venture trade abroad others like soldiers armed in their stings make boot upon the summer 's velvet buds which pillage they with merry march bring home to the tent royal of their emperor who busied in his majesty surveys the singing masons building roofs of gold the civil citizens kneading up the honey the poor mechanic porters crowding in their heavy burdens at his narrow gate the sad eyed justice with his surly hum delivering o'er to executors pale the lazy yawning drone i this infer that many things having full reference to one consent may work contrariously as many arrows loosed several ways come to one mark as many ways meet in one town as many fresh streams meet in one salt sea as many lines close in the dial 's centre so may a thousand actions once afoot end in one purpose and be all well borne without defeat therefore to france my liege divide your happy england into four whereof take you one quarter into france and you withal shall make all gallia shake if we with thrice such powers left at home can not defend our own doors from the dog let us be worried and our nation lose the name of hardiness and policy call in the messengers sent from the dauphin exeunt some attendants now are we well resolved and by god 's help and yours the noble sinews of our power france being ours we 'll bend it to our awe or break it all to pieces or there we 'll sit ruling in large and ample empery o'er france and all her almost kingly dukedoms or lay these bones in an unworthy urn tombless with no remembrance over them either our history shall with full mouth speak freely of our acts or else our grave like turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph enter ambassadors of france now are we well prepared to know the pleasure of our fair cousin dauphin for we hear your greeting is from him not from the king may't please your majesty to give us leave freely to render what we have in charge or shall we sparingly show you far off the dauphin 's meaning and our embassy we are no tyrant but a christian king unto whose grace our passion is as subject as are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness tell us the dauphin 's mind thus then in few your highness lately sending into france did claim some certain dukedoms in the right of your great predecessor king edward the third in answer of which claim the prince our master says that you savour too much of your youth and bids you be advised there 's nought in france that can be with a nimble galliard won you can not revel into dukedoms there he therefore sends you meeter for your spirit this tun of treasure and in lieu of this desires you let the dukedoms that you claim hear no more of you this the dauphin speaks what treasure uncle tennis balls my liege we are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us his present and your pains we thank you for when we have march'd our rackets to these balls we will in france by god 's grace play a set shall strike his father 's crown into the hazard tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler that all the courts of france will be disturb'd with chaces and we understand him well how he comes o'er us with our wilder days not measuring what use we made of them we never valued this poor seat of england and therefore living hence did give ourself to barbarous licence as tis ever common that men are merriest when they are from home but tell the dauphin i will keep my state be like a king and show my sail of greatness when i do rouse me in my throne of france for that i have laid by my majesty and plodded like a man for working days but i will rise there with so full a glory that i will dazzle all the eyes of france yea strike the dauphin blind to look on us and tell the pleasant prince this mock of his hath turn'd his balls to gun stones and his soul shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance that shall fly with them for many a thousand widows shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands mock mothers from their sons mock castles down and some are yet ungotten and unborn that shall have cause to curse the dauphin 's scorn but this lies all within the will of god to whom i do appeal and in whose name tell you the dauphin i am coming on to venge me as i may and to put forth my rightful hand in a well hallow'd cause so get you hence in peace and tell the dauphin his jest will savour but of shallow wit when thousands weep more than did laugh at it convey them with safe conduct fare you well exeunt ambassadors this was a merry message we hope to make the sender blush at it therefore my lords omit no happy hour that may give furtherance to our expedition for we have now no thought in us but france save those to god that run before our business therefore let our proportions for these wars be soon collected and all things thought upon that may with reasonable swiftness add more feathers to our wings for god before we 'll chide this dauphin at his father 's door therefore let every man now task his thought that this fair action may on foot be brought exeunt flourish act ii prologue enter chorus now all the youth of england are on fire and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies now thrive the

fault and do submit me to your highness mercy to which we all appeal the mercy that was quick in us but late by your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd you must not dare for shame to talk of mercy for your own reasons turn into your bosoms as dogs upon their masters worrying you see you my princes and my noble peers these english monsters my lord of cambridge here you know how apt our love was to accord to furnish him with all appertinents belonging to his honour and this man hath for a few light crowns lightly conspired and sworn unto the practises of france to kill us here in hampton to the which this knight no less for bounty bound to us than cambridge is hath likewise sworn but o what shall i say to thee lord scroop thou cruel ingrateful savage and inhuman creature thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels that knew'st the very bottom of my soul that almost mightst have coin'd me into gold wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use may it be possible that foreign hire could out of thee extract one spark of evil that might annoy my finger tis so strange that though the truth of it stands off as gross as black and white my eye will scarcely see it treason and murder ever kept together as two yoke devils sworn to either 's purpose working so grossly in a natural cause that admiration did not whoop at them but thou gainst all proportion didst bring in wonder to wait on treason and on murder and whatsoever cunning fiend it was that wrought upon thee so preposterously hath got the voice in hell for excellence all other devils that suggest by treasons do botch and bungle up damnation with patches colours and with forms being fetch'd from glistering semblances of piety but he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason unless to dub thee with the name of traitor if that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus should with his lion gait walk the whole world he might return to vasty tartar back and tell the legions i can never win a soul so easy as that englishman 's o how hast thou with jealousy infected the sweetness of affiance show men dutiful why so didst thou seem they grave and learned why so didst thou come they of noble family why so didst thou seem they religious why so didst thou or are they spare in diet free from gross passion or of mirth or anger constant in spirit not swerving with the blood garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement not working with the eye without the ear and but in purged judgment trusting neither such and so finely bolted didst thou seem and thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot to mark the full fraught man and best indued with some suspicion i will weep for thee for this revolt of thine methinks is like another fall of man their faults are open arrest them to the answer of the law and god acquit them of their practises i arrest thee of high treason by the name of richard earl of cambridge i arrest thee of high treason by the name of henry lord scroop of masham i arrest thee of high treason by the name of thomas grey knight of northumberland our purposes god justly hath discover'd and i repent my fault more than my death which i beseech your highness to forgive although my body pay the price of it for me the gold of france did not seduce although i did admit it as a motive the sooner to effect what i intended but god be thanked for prevention which i in sufferance heartily will rejoice beseeching god and you to pardon me never did faithful subject more rejoice at the discovery of most dangerous treason than i do at this hour joy o'er myself prevented from a damned enterprise my fault but not my body pardon sovereign god quit you in his mercy hear your sentence you have conspired against our royal person join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers received the golden earnest of our death wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter his princes and his peers to servitude his subjects to oppression and contempt and his whole kingdom into desolation touching our person seek we no revenge but we our kingdom 's safety must so tender whose ruin you have sought that to her laws we do deliver you get you

left by the fatal and neglected english upon our fields my most redoubted father it is most meet we arm us gainst the foe for peace itself should not so dull a kingdom though war nor no known quarrel were in question but that defences musters preparations should be maintain'd assembled and collected as were a war in expectation therefore i say tis meet we all go forth to view the sick and feeble parts of france and let us do it with no show of fear no with no more than if we heard that england were busied with a whitsun morris dance for my good liege she is so idly king'd her sceptre so fantastically borne by a vain giddy shallow humorous youth that fear attends her not o peace prince dauphin you are too much mistaken in this king question your grace the late ambassadors with what great state he heard their embassy how well supplied with noble counsellors how modest in exception and withal how terrible in constant resolution and you shall find his vanities forespent were but

projection doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting a little cloth think we king harry strong and princes look you strongly arm to meet him the kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us and he is bred out of that bloody strain that haunted us in our familiar paths witness our too much memorable shame when cressy battle fatally was struck and all our princes captiv'd by the hand of that black name edward black prince of wales whiles that his mountain sire on mountain standing up in the air crown'd with the golden sun saw his heroical seed and smiled to see him mangle the work of nature and

wide stretched honours that pertain by custom and the ordinance of times unto the crown of france that you may know tis no sinister nor no awkward claim pick'd from the worm holes of long vanish'd days nor from the dust of old oblivion raked he sends you this most memorable line in every branch truly demonstrative willing to overlook this pedigree and when you find him evenly derived from his most famed of famous ancestors edward the third he bids you then resign your crown and kingdom indirectly held from him the native and true challenger or else what follows bloody constraint for if you hide the crown even in your hearts there will he rake for it therefore in fierce tempest is he coming in thunder and in earthquake like a jove that if requiring fail he will compel and bids you in the bowels of the lord deliver up the crown and to take mercy on the poor souls for whom this hungry war opens his vasty jaws and on your head turning the widows tears the orphans cries the dead men 's

promise of his greener days and these he masters now now he weighs time even to the utmost grain that you shall read in your own losses if he stay in france to morrow shall you know our mind at full

by the means whereof a breaks words and keeps whole weapons for nym he hath heard that men of few words are the best men and therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest a should be thought a coward but his few bad words are matched with as few good deeds for a never broke any man 's head but his own and that was against a post when he was drunk they will steal any thing and call it purchase bardolph stole a lute case bore it twelve leagues and sold it for three half pence nym and bardolph are sworn brothers in filching and in calais they stole a fire shovel i knew by that piece of

bring us word of england 's fall exeunt scene vi the english camp in picardy enter gower and fluellen meeting how now captain fluellen come you from the bridge i assure you there is very excellent services committed at the bridge is the duke of exeter safe the duke of exeter is as magnanimous as agamemnon and a man that i love and honour with my soul and my heart and my duty and my life and my living and my uttermost power he is not god be praised and blessed!--any hurt in the world but keeps the bridge most valiantly with excellent discipline there is an aunchient lieutenant there at the pridge i think in my very conscience he is as valiant a man as mark antony and he is a man of no estimation in the world but did see him do as gallant service what do you call him he is called aunchient pistol i know him not enter pistol here is the man captain i thee beseech to do me favours the duke of exeter doth love thee well ay i praise god and i have merited some love at his hands bardolph a soldier firm and sound of heart and of buxom valour hath by cruel fate and giddy fortune 's furious fickle wheel that goddess blind that stands upon the rolling restless stone-- by your patience aunchient pistol fortune is painted blind with a muffler afore her eyes to signify to you that fortune is blind and she is painted also with a wheel to signify to you which is the moral of it that she is turning and inconstant and mutability and variation and her foot look you is fixed upon a spherical stone which rolls and rolls and rolls in good truth the poet makes a most excellent description of it fortune is an excellent moral fortune is bardolph 's foe and frowns on him for he hath stolen a pax and hanged must a be a damned death let gallows gape for dog let man go free and let not hemp his wind pipe suffocate but exeter hath given the doom of death for pax of little price therefore go speak the duke will hear thy voice and let not bardolph 's vital thread be cut with edge of penny cord and vile reproach speak captain for his life and i will thee requite aunchient pistol i do partly understand your meaning why then rejoice therefore certainly aunchient it is not a thing to rejoice at for if look you he were my brother i would desire the duke to use his good pleasure and put him to execution for discipline ought to be used die and be damn'd and figo for thy friendship it is well the fig of spain exit very good why this is an arrant counterfeit rascal i remember him now a bawd a cutpurse i 'll assure you a uttered as brave words at the bridge as you shall see in a summer 's day but it is very well what he has spoke to me that is well i warrant you when time is serve why tis a gull a fool a rogue that now and then goes to the wars to grace himself at his return into london under the form of a soldier and such fellows are perfect in the great commanders names and they will learn you by rote where services were done at such and such a sconce at such a breach at such a convoy who came off bravely who was shot who disgraced what terms the enemy stood on and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war which they trick up with new tuned oaths and what a beard of the general 's cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and ale washed wits is wonderful to be thought on but you must learn to know such slanders of the age or else you may be marvellously mistook i tell you what captain gower i do perceive he is not the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is if i find a hole in his coat i will tell him my mind drum heard hark you the king is coming and i must speak with him from the pridge drum and colours enter king henry gloucester and soldiers god pless your majesty how now fluellen camest thou from the bridge ay so please your majesty the duke of exeter has very gallantly maintained the pridge the french is gone off look you and there is gallant and most prave passages marry th athversary was have possession of the pridge but he is enforced to retire and the duke of exeter is master of the pridge i can tell your majesty the duke is a prave man what men have you lost fluellen the perdition of th athversary hath been very great reasonable great marry for my part i think the duke hath lost never a man but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church one bardolph if your majesty know the man his face is all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o fire and his lips blows at his nose and it is like a coal of fire sometimes plue and sometimes red but his nose is executed and his fire 's out we would have all such offenders so cut off and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages nothing taken but paid for none of the french upbraided or abused in disdainful language for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the gentler gamester is the soonest winner tucket enter montjoy you know me by my habit well then i know thee what shall i know of thee my master 's mind unfold it thus says my king say thou to harry of england though we seemed dead we did but sleep advantage is a better soldier than rashness tell him we could have rebuked him at harfleur but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe now we speak upon our cue and our voice is imperial england shall repent his folly see his weakness and admire our sufferance bid him therefore consider of his ransom which must proportion the losses we have borne the subjects we have lost the disgrace we have digested which in weight to re answer his pettiness would bow under for our losses his exchequer is too poor for the effusion of our blood the muster of his kingdom too faint a number and for our disgrace his own person kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction to this add defiance and tell him for conclusion he hath betrayed his followers whose condemnation is pronounced so far my king and master so much my office what is thy name i know thy quality montjoy thou dost thy office fairly turn thee back and tell thy king i do not seek him now but could be willing to march on to calais without impeachment for to say the sooth though tis no wisdom to confess so much unto an enemy of craft and vantage my people are with sickness much enfeebled my numbers lessened and those few i have almost no better than so many french who when they were in health i tell thee herald i thought upon one pair of english legs did march three frenchmen yet forgive me god that i do brag thus this your air of france hath blown that vice in me i must repent go therefore tell thy master here i am my ransom is this frail and worthless trunk my army but a weak and sickly guard yet god before tell him we will come on though france himself and such another neighbour stand in our way there 's for thy labour montjoy go bid thy master well advise himself if we may pass we will if we be hinder'd we shall your tawny ground with your red blood discolour and so montjoy fare you well the sum of all our answer is but this we would not seek a battle as we are nor as we are we say we will not shun it so tell your master i shall deliver so thanks to your highness exit i hope they will not come upon us now we are in god 's hand brother not in theirs march to the bridge it now draws toward night beyond the river we 'll encamp ourselves and on to morrow bid them march away exeunt scene vii the french camp near agincourt enter the constable of france the lord rambures orleans dauphin with others tut i

ca ha he bounds from the earth as if his entrails were hairs le cheval volant the pegasus chez les narines de feu when i bestride him i soar i am a hawk he trots the air the earth sings when he touches it the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of hermes he 's of the colour of the nutmeg and of the heat of the ginger it is a beast for perseus he is pure air and fire and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him he is indeed a horse and all other jades you may call beasts indeed my lord it is a most absolute and excellent horse it is the prince of palfreys his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage no more cousin nay the man hath no wit that can not from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary deserved praise on my palfrey it is a theme as fluent as the sea turn the sands into eloquent tongues and my horse is argument for them all tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on and for a sovereign 's sovereign to ride on and for the world familiar to us and unknown to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him i once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus wonder of nature,'-- i have heard a sonnet begin so to one 's mistress then did they imitate that which i composed to my courser for my horse is my mistress your mistress bears well me well which is the prescript praise and perfection of a good and particular mistress nay for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your back so perhaps did yours mine was not bridled o then belike she was old and gentle and you rode like a kern of ireland your french hose off and in your straight strossers you have good judgment in horsemanship be warned by me then they that ride so and ride not warily fall into foul bogs i had rather have my horse to my mistress i had as lief have my mistress a jade i tell thee constable my mistress wears his own hair i could make as true a boast as that if i had a sow to my mistress le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement et la truie lavee au bourbier thou makest use of any thing yet do i not use my horse for my mistress or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose my lord constable the armour that i saw in your tent to night are those stars or suns upon it stars my lord some of them will fall to morrow i hope and yet my sky shall not want that may be for you bear a many superfluously and twere more honour some were away even as your horse bears your praises who would trot as well were some of your brags dismounted would i were able to load him with his desert will it never be day i will trot to morrow a mile and my way shall be paved with english faces i will not say so for fear i should be faced out of my way but i would it were morning for i would fain be about the ears of the english who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners you must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them tis midnight i 'll go arm myself exit the dauphin longs for morning he longs to eat the english i think he will eat all he kills by the white hand of my lady he 's a gallant prince swear by her foot that she may tread out the oath he is simply the most active gentleman of france doing is activity and he will still be doing he never did harm that i heard of nor will do none to morrow he will keep that good name still i know him to be valiant i was told that   by one that knows him better than you what 's he marry he told me so himself and he said he cared not who knew it he needs not it is no hidden virtue in him by my faith sir but it is never any body saw it but his lackey tis a hooded valour and when it appears it will bate ill will never said well i will cap that proverb with there is flattery in friendship and i will take up that with give the devil his due well placed there stands your friend for the devil have at the very eye of that proverb with a pox of the devil you

hundred paces of your tents who hath measured the ground the lord grandpre a valiant and most expert gentleman would it were day alas poor harry of england he longs not for the dawning as we do what a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of england to mope with his fat brained followers so far out of his knowledge if the english had any apprehension they would run away that they lack for if their heads had any intellectual armour they could never wear such heavy head pieces that island of england breeds very valiant creatures their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage foolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a russian bear and have their heads crushed like rotten apples you may as well say that 's a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion just just and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on leaving their wits with their wives and then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel they will eat like wolves and fight like devils ay but these english are shrewdly out of beef then shall we find to morrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight now is it time to arm come shall we about it it is now two

answers fire and through their paly flames each battle sees the other 's umber'd face steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs piercing the night 's dull ear and from the tents the armourers accomplishing the knights with busy hammers closing rivets up give dreadful note of preparation the country cocks do crow the clocks do toll and the third hour of drowsy morning name proud of their numbers and secure in soul the confident and over lusty french do the low rated english play at dice and chide the cripple tardy gaited night who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp so tediously away the poor condemned english like sacrifices by their watchful fires sit patiently and inly ruminate the morning 's danger and their gesture sad investing lank lean cheeks and war worn coats presenteth them unto the gazing moon so many horrid ghosts o now who will behold the royal captain of this ruin'd band walking from watch to watch from tent to tent let him cry praise and glory on his head for forth he goes and visits all his host bids them good morrow with a modest smile and calls them brothers friends and countrymen upon his royal face there is no note how dread an army hath enrounded him nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour unto the weary and all watched night but freshly looks and over bears attaint with cheerful semblance and sweet majesty that every wretch pining and pale before beholding him plucks comfort from his looks a largess universal like the sun his liberal eye doth give to every one thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all behold as may unworthiness define a little touch of harry in the night and so our scene must to the battle fly where o for pity!--we shall much disgrace with four or five most vile and ragged foils right ill disposed in brawl ridiculous the name of agincourt yet sit and see minding true things by what their mockeries be exit scene i. the english camp at agincourt enter king henry bedford and gloucester gloucester tis true that we are in great danger the greater therefore should our courage be good morrow brother bedford god almighty there is some soul of goodness in things evil would men observingly distil it out for our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers which is both healthful and good husbandry besides they are our outward consciences and preachers to us all admonishing that we should dress us fairly for our end thus may we gather honey from the weed and make a moral of the devil himself enter erpingham good morrow old sir thomas erpingham a good soft pillow for that good white head were better than a

saint davy 's day do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day lest he knock that about yours art thou his friend and his kinsman too the figo for thee then i thank you god be with you my name is pistol call'd exit it sorts well with your fierceness enter fluellen and gower captain fluellen so in the name of jesu christ speak lower it is the greatest admiration of the universal world when the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept if you would take the pains but to examine the wars of pompey the great you shall find i warrant you that there is no tiddle toddle nor pibble pabble in pompey 's camp i warrant you you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise why the enemy is loud you hear him all night if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also look you be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb in your own conscience now i will speak lower i pray you and beseech you that you will exeunt gower and fluellen though it appear a little out of fashion there is much care and valour in this welshman enter three soldiers john bates alexander court and michael williams brother john bates is not that the morning which breaks yonder i think it be but we have no great cause to desire the approach of day we see yonder the beginning of the day but i think we shall never see the end of it who goes there a friend under what captain serve you under sir thomas erpingham a good old commander and a most kind gentleman i pray you what thinks he of our estate even as men wrecked upon a sand that look to be washed off the next tide he hath not told his thought to the king no nor it is not meet he should for though i speak it to you i think the king is but a man as i am the violet smells to him as it doth to me the element shows to him as it doth to me all his senses have but human conditions his ceremonies laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with the like wing therefore when he sees reason of fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his army he may show what outward courage he will but i believe as cold a night as tis he could wish himself in thames up to the neck and so i would he were and i by him at all adventures so we were quit here by my troth i will speak my conscience of the king i think he would not wish himself any where but where he is then i would he were here alone so should he be sure to be ransomed and a many poor men 's lives saved i dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone howsoever you speak this to feel other men 's minds methinks i could not die any where so contented as in the king 's company his cause being just and his quarrel honourable that 's more than we know ay or more than we should seek after for we know enough if we know we are the kings subjects if his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us but if the cause be not good the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads chopped off in battle shall join together at the latter day and cry all we died at such a place some swearing some crying for a surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind them some upon the debts they owe some upon their children rawly left i am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle for how can they charitably dispose of any thing when blood is their argument now if these men do not die well it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it whom to disobey were against all proportion of subjection so if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon his father that sent him or if a servant under his master 's command transporting a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities you may call the business of the master the author of the servant 's damnation but this is not so the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services besides there is no king be his cause never so spotless if it come to the arbitrement of swords can try it out with all unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the wars their bulwark that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery now if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they have no wings to fly from god war is his beadle war is vengeance so that here men are punished for before breach of the king 's laws in now the king 's quarrel where they feared the death they have borne life away and where they would be safe they perish then if they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited every subject 's duty is the king 's but every subject 's soul is his own therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every mote out of his conscience and dying so death is to him advantage or not dying the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained and in him that escapes it were not sin to think that making god so free an offer he let him outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach others how they should prepare tis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon his own head the king is not to answer it but i do not desire he should answer for me and yet i determine to fight lustily for him i myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed ay he said so to make us fight cheerfully but when our throats are cut he may be ransomed and we ne'er the wiser if i live to see it i will never trust his word after you pay him then that 's a perilous shot out of an elder gun that a poor and private displeasure can do against a monarch you may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock 's feather you 'll never trust his word after come tis a foolish saying your reproof is something too round i should be angry with you if the time were convenient let it be a quarrel between us if you live i embrace it how shall i know thee again give me any gage of thine and i will wear it in my bonnet then if ever thou darest acknowledge it i will make it my quarrel here 's my glove give me another of thine there this will i also wear in my cap if ever thou come to me and say after to morrow this is my glove by this hand i will take thee a box on the ear if ever i live to see it i will challenge it thou darest as well be hanged well i will do it though i take thee in the king 's company keep thy word fare thee well be friends you english fools be friends we have french quarrels enow if you could tell how to reckon indeed the french may lay twenty french crowns to one they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders but it is no english treason to cut french crowns and to morrow the king himself will be a clipper exeunt soldiers upon the king let us our lives our souls our debts our careful wives our children and our sins lay on the king we must bear all o hard condition twin born with greatness subject to the breath of every fool whose sense no more can feel but his own wringing what infinite heart's ease must kings neglect that private men enjoy and what have kings that privates have not too save ceremony save general ceremony and what art thou thou idle ceremony what kind of god art thou that suffer'st more of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers what are thy rents what are thy comings in o ceremony show me but thy worth what is thy soul of adoration art thou aught else but place degree and form creating awe and fear in other men wherein thou art less happy being fear'd than they in fearing what drink'st thou oft instead of homage sweet but poison'd flattery o be sick great greatness and bid thy ceremony give thee cure think'st thou the fiery fever will go out with titles blown from adulation will it give place to flexure and low bending canst thou when thou command'st the beggar 's knee command the health of it no thou proud dream that play'st so subtly with a king 's repose i am a king that find thee and i know tis not the balm the sceptre and the ball the sword the mace the crown imperial the intertissued robe of gold and pearl the farced title running fore the king the throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp that beats upon the high shore of this world no not all these thrice gorgeous ceremony not all these laid in bed majestical can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave who with a body fill'd and vacant mind gets him to rest cramm'd with distressful bread never sees horrid night the child of hell but like a lackey from the rise to set sweats in the eye of phoebus and all night sleeps in elysium next day after dawn doth rise and help hyperion to his horse and follows so the ever running year with profitable labour to his grave and but for ceremony such a wretch winding up days with toil and nights with sleep had the fore hand and vantage of a king the slave a member of the country 's peace enjoys it but in gross brain little wots what watch the king keeps to maintain the peace whose hours the

superfluous lackeys and our peasants who in unnecessary action swarm about our squares of battle were enow to purge this field of such a hilding foe though we upon this mountain 's basis by took stand

the horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks with torch staves in their hand and their poor jades lob down their heads dropping the hides and hips the gum down roping from their pale dead eyes and in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit lies foul with chew'd grass still and motionless and their executors the knavish crows fly o'er them all impatient for their hour description can not suit itself in words to demonstrate the life of such a battle in life so lifeless as it shows itself they have said their prayers and they stay for death shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits and give

wish not a man from england god 's peace i would not lose so great an honour as one man more methinks would share from me for the best hope i have o do not wish one more rather proclaim it westmoreland through my host that he which hath no stomach to this fight let him depart his passport shall be made and crowns for convoy put into his purse we would not die in that man 's company that fears his fellowship to die with us this day is called the feast of crispian he that outlives this day and comes safe home will stand a tip toe when the day is named and rouse him at the name of

called philip of macedon as i take it i think it is in macedon where alexander is porn i tell you captain if you look in the maps of the orld i warrant you sall find in the comparisons between macedon and monmouth that the situations look you is both alike there is a river in macedon and there is also moreover a river at monmouth it is called wye at monmouth but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river but tis all one tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers and there is salmons in both if you mark alexander 's life well harry of monmouth 's life is come after it indifferent

congreeted let it not disgrace me if i demand before this royal view what rub or what impediment there is why that the naked poor and mangled peace dear nurse of arts and joyful births should not in this best garden of the world our fertile france put up her lovely visage alas she hath from france too long been chased and all her husbandry doth lie on heaps corrupting in its own fertility her vine the merry cheerer of the heart unpruned dies her hedges even pleach'd like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair put forth disorder'd twigs her fallow leas the darnel hemlock and rank fumitory doth root upon while that the coulter rusts that should deracinate such savagery the even mead that erst brought sweetly forth the freckled cowslip burnet and green clover wanting the scythe all uncorrected rank conceives by idleness and nothing teems but hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs losing both beauty and utility and as our vineyards fallows meads and hedges defective in their natures grow to wildness even so our houses and ourselves and children have lost or do not learn for want of time the sciences that should become our country but grow like savages,--as soldiers will that nothing do but meditate on blood,-- to swearing and stern looks diffused attire and every thing that seems unnatural which to reduce into our former favour you are assembled and my speech entreats that i may know the let why gentle peace should not expel these inconveniences and bless us with her former qualities if duke of burgundy you would the peace whose want gives growth to the imperfections which you have cited you must buy that peace with full accord to all our just demands whose tenors and particular effects you have enscheduled briefly in your hands the king hath heard them to the which as yet there is no answer made well then the peace which you before so urged lies in his answer i have but with a cursorary eye o'erglanced the articles pleaseth your grace to

or to dance for your sake kate why you undid me for the one i have neither words nor measure and for the other i have no strength in measure yet a reasonable measure in strength if i could win a lady at leap frog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armour on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken i should quickly leap into a wife or if i might buffet for my love or bound my horse for her favours i could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jack an apes never off but before god kate i can not look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence nor i have no cunning in protestation only downright oaths which i never use till urged nor never break for urging if thou canst love a fellow of this temper kate whose face is not worth sun burning that never looks in his glass for love of any thing he sees there let thine eye be thy cook i speak to thee plain soldier if thou canst love me for this take me if not to say to thee that i shall die is true but for thy love by the lord no yet i love thee too and while thou livest dear kate take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places for these fellows of infinite tongue that can rhyme themselves into ladies favours they do always reason themselves out again what a speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad a good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will turn white a curled pate will grow bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax hollow but a good heart kate is the sun and the moon or rather the sun

to my love speak my fair and fairly i pray thee is it possible dat i sould love de enemy of france no it is not possible you should love the enemy of france kate but in loving me you should love the friend of france for i love france so well that i will not part with a village of it i will have it all mine and kate when france is mine and i am yours then yours is france and you are mine i can not

so much more french i shall never move thee in french unless it be to laugh at me sauf votre honneur le francois que vous parlez il est meilleur que l'anglois lequel je parle no faith is't not kate but thy speaking of my tongue and i thine most truly falsely must needs be granted to be much at one but kate dost thou understand thus much english canst thou love me i can not tell can any of your neighbours tell kate i 'll ask them come i know thou lovest me and at night when you come into your closet you 'll question this gentlewoman about me and i know kate you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart but good kate mock me mercifully the rather gentle princess because i love thee cruelly if ever thou beest mine kate as i have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt i get thee with scambling and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldier breeder shall not thou and i between saint denis and saint george compound a boy half french half english that shall go to constantinople and take the turk by the beard shall we not what sayest thou my fair flower de luce i do not know dat no tis hereafter to know but now to promise do but now promise

when he got me therefore was i created with a stubborn outside with an aspect of iron that when i come to woo ladies i fright them but in faith kate the elder i wax the better i shall appear my comfort is that old age that ill layer up of beauty can do no more spoil upon my face thou hast me if thou hast me at the worst and thou shalt wear me if thou wear me better and better and therefore tell me most fair katharine will you have me put off your maiden blushes avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress take me by the hand and say harry of england i am thine which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal but i will tell thee aloud england is thine ireland is thine france is thine and harry plantagenet is thine who though i speak it before his face if he

her learn my fair cousin how perfectly i love her and that is good english is she not apt our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not smooth so that having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me i can not so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness pardon the frankness of my mirth if i answer you for that if you would conjure in her you must make a circle if conjure up love in her in his true likeness he must appear naked and blind can you blame her then being a maid yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self it were my lord a hard condition for a maid to consign to yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and enforces they are then excused my lord when they see not what they do then good my lord teach your cousin to consent winking i will wink on her to consent my lord if you will teach her to know my meaning for maids well summered and warm kept are like flies at bartholomew tide blind though they have their eyes and then they will endure handling which before would not abide looking on this moral ties me over to time and a hot

use or purblind argus all eyes and no sight but how should this man that makes me smile make hector angry they say he yesterday coped hector in the battle and struck him down the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since kept hector fasting and waking who comes here madam your uncle pandarus enter pandarus hector 's a gallant man as may be in the world lady what 's that what 's that good morrow uncle pandarus good morrow cousin cressid what do you talk of good morrow alexander how do you cousin when were you at ilium this morning uncle what were you talking of when i came was hector armed and gone ere ye came to ilium helen was not up was she hector was gone but helen was not up even so hector was stirring early that were we talking of and of his anger was he angry so he says here true he was so i know the cause too he 'll lay about him to day i can tell them that and there 's troilus will not come far behind him let them take heed of troilus i can tell them that too what is he angry too who troilus troilus is the better man of the two o jupiter there 's no comparison what not between troilus and hector do you know a man if you see him ay if i ever saw him before and knew him well i say troilus is troilus then you say as i say for i am sure he is not hector no nor hector is not troilus in some degrees tis just to each of them he is himself himself alas poor troilus i would he were so he is condition i had gone barefoot to india he is not hector himself no he 's not himself would a were himself well the gods are above time must friend or end well troilus well i would my heart were in her body no hector is not a better man than troilus excuse me he is elder pardon me pardon me th other 's not come to't you shall tell me another tale when th other 's come to't hector shall not have his wit this year he shall not need it if he have his own nor his qualities no matter nor his beauty twould not become him his own 's better you have no judgment niece helen herself swore th other day that troilus for a brown favour for so tis i must confess,-- not brown neither,-- no but brown faith to say truth brown and not brown to say the truth true and not true she praised his complexion above paris why paris hath colour enough so he has then troilus should have too much if she praised him above his complexion is higher than his he having colour enough and the other higher is too flaming a praise for a good complexion i had as lief helen 's golden tongue had commended troilus for a copper nose i swear to you i think helen loves him better than paris then she 's a merry greek indeed nay i am sure she does she came to him th other day into the compassed window,--and you know he has not past three or four hairs on his chin,-- indeed a tapster 's arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a total why he is very young and yet will he within three pound lift as much as his brother hector is he so young a man and so old a lifter but to prove to you that helen loves him she came and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin-- juno have mercy how came it cloven why you know tis dimpled i think his smiling becomes him better than any man in all phrygia o he smiles valiantly does he not o yes an twere a cloud in autumn why go to then but to prove to you that helen loves troilus,-- troilus will stand to the proof if you 'll prove it so troilus why he esteems her no more than i esteem an addle egg if you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head you would eat chickens i the shell i can not choose but laugh to think how she tickled his chin indeed she has a marvellous white hand i must needs confess,-- without the rack and she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin alas poor chin many a wart is richer but there was such laughing queen hecuba laughed that her eyes ran o'er with mill stones and cassandra laughed but there was more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes did her eyes run o'er too and hector laughed at what was all this laughing marry at the white hair that helen spied on troilus chin an't had been a green hair i should have laughed too they laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer what was his answer quoth she here 's but two and fifty hairs on your chin and one of them is white this is her question that 's true make no question of that two and fifty hairs quoth he and one white that white hair is my father and all the rest are his sons jupiter quoth she which of these hairs is paris my husband the forked one quoth he pluck't out and give it him but there was such laughing and helen so blushed an paris so chafed and all the rest so laughed that it passed so let it now for it has been while going by well cousin i told you a thing yesterday think on't so i do i 'll be sworn tis true he will weep you an twere a man born in april and i 'll spring up in his tears an twere a nettle against may a retreat sounded hark they are coming from the field

the eyes of troilus ne'er look ne'er look the eagles are gone crows and daws crows and daws i had rather be such a man as troilus than agamemnon and all greece there is among the greeks achilles a better man than troilus achilles a drayman a porter a very camel well well well well why have you any discretion have you any eyes do you know what a man is is not birth beauty good shape discourse manhood learning gentleness virtue youth liberality and such like the spice and salt that season a man ay a minced man and then to be baked with no date in the pie for then the man 's date 's out you are such a woman one knows not at what ward you lie upon my back to defend my belly upon my wit to defend my wiles upon my secrecy to defend mine honesty my mask to defend my beauty and you to defend all these and at all these wards i lie at a thousand watches say one of your watches nay i 'll watch you for that and that 's one of the chiefest of them too if i can not ward what i would not have hit i can watch you for telling how i took the blow unless it swell past hiding and then it 's past watching you are such another enter troilus 's boy sir my lord would instantly speak with you where at your own house there he unarms him good boy tell him i come exit boy i doubt he be hurt fare ye well good niece adieu uncle i 'll be with you niece by and by to bring uncle ay a token from troilus by the same token you are a bawd exit pandarus words vows gifts tears and love 's full sacrifice he offers in another 's enterprise but more in troilus thousand fold i see than in the glass of pandar 's praise may be yet hold i off women are angels wooing things won are done joy 's soul lies in the doing that she beloved knows nought that knows not this men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is that she was never yet that ever knew love got so sweet as when desire did sue therefore this maxim out of love i teach achievement is command ungain'd beseech then though my heart 's content firm love doth bear nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear exeunt scene iii the grecian camp before agamemnon 's tent sennet enter agamemnon nestor ulysses menelaus and others princes what grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks the ample proposition that hope makes in all designs begun on earth below fails in the promised largeness cheques and disasters grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd as knots by the conflux of meeting sap infect the sound pine and divert his grain tortive and errant from his course of growth nor princes is it matter new to us that we come short of our suppose so far that after seven years siege yet troy walls stand sith every action that hath gone before whereof we have record trial did draw bias and thwart not answering the aim and that unbodied figure of the thought that gave't surmised shape why then you princes do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works and call them shames which are indeed nought else but the protractive trials of great jove to find persistive constancy in men the fineness of which metal is not found in fortune 's love for then the bold and coward the wise and fool the artist and unread the hard and soft seem all affined and kin but in the wind and tempest of her frown distinction with a broad and powerful fan puffing at all winnows the light away and what hath mass or matter by itself lies rich in virtue and unmingled with due observance of thy godlike seat great agamemnon nestor shall apply thy latest words in the reproof of chance lies the true proof of men the sea being smooth how many shallow bauble boats dare sail upon her patient breast making their way with those of nobler bulk but let the ruffian boreas once enrage the gentle thetis and anon behold the strong ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut bounding between the two moist elements like perseus horse where 's then the saucy boat whose weak untimber'd sides but even now co rivall'd greatness either to harbour fled or made a toast for neptune even so doth valour 's show and valour 's worth divide in storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness the herd hath more annoyance by the breeze than by the tiger but when the splitting wind makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks and flies fled under shade why then the thing of courage as roused with rage with rage doth sympathize and with an accent tuned in selfsame key retorts to chiding fortune agamemnon thou great commander nerve and bone of greece heart of our numbers soul and only spirit in whom the tempers and the minds of all should be shut up hear what ulysses speaks besides the applause and approbation to which to agamemnon most mighty for thy place and sway to nestor and thou most reverend for thy stretch'd out life i give to both your speeches which were such as agamemnon and the hand of greece should hold up high in brass and such again as venerable nestor hatch'd in silver should with a bond of air strong as the axle tree on which heaven rides knit all the greekish ears to his experienced tongue yet let it please both thou great and wise to hear ulysses speak speak prince of ithaca and be't of less expect that matter needless of importless burden divide thy lips than we are confident when rank thersites opes his mastic jaws we shall hear music wit and oracle troy yet upon his basis had been down and the great hector 's sword had lack'd a master but for these instances the specialty of rule hath been neglected and look how many grecian tents do stand hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions when that the general is not like the hive to whom the foragers shall all repair what honey is expected degree being vizarded the unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask the heavens themselves the planets and this centre observe degree priority and place insisture course proportion season form office and custom in all line of order and therefore is the glorious planet sol in noble eminence enthroned and sphered amidst the other whose medicinable eye corrects the ill aspects of planets evil and posts like the commandment of a king sans cheque to good and bad but when the planets in evil mixture to disorder wander what plagues and what portents what mutiny what raging of the sea shaking of earth commotion in the winds frights changes horrors divert and crack rend and deracinate the unity and married calm of states quite from their fixure o when degree is shaked which is the ladder to all high designs then enterprise is sick how could communities degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities peaceful commerce from dividable shores the primogenitive and due of birth prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels but by degree stand in authentic place take but degree away untune that string and hark what discord follows each thing meets in mere oppugnancy the bounded waters should lift their bosoms higher than the shores and make a sop of all this solid globe strength should be lord of imbecility and the rude son should strike his father dead force should be right or rather right and wrong between whose endless jar justice resides should lose their names and so should justice too then every thing includes itself in power power into will will into appetite and appetite an universal wolf so doubly seconded with will and power must make perforce an universal prey and last eat up himself great agamemnon this chaos when degree is suffocate follows the choking and this neglection of degree it is that by a pace goes backward with a purpose it hath to climb the general 's disdain'd by him one step below he by the next that next by him beneath so every step exampled by the first pace that is sick of his superior grows to an envious fever of pale and bloodless emulation and tis this fever that keeps troy on foot not her own sinews to end a tale of length troy in our weakness stands not in her strength most wisely hath ulysses here discover'd the fever whereof all our power is sick the nature of the sickness found ulysses what is the remedy the great achilles whom opinion crowns the sinew and the forehand of our host having his ear full of his airy fame grows dainty of his worth and in his tent lies mocking our designs with him patroclus upon a lazy bed the livelong day breaks scurril jests and with ridiculous and awkward action which slanderer he imitation calls he pageants us sometime great agamemnon thy topless deputation he puts on and like a strutting player whose conceit lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich to hear the wooden dialogue and sound twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,-- such to be pitied and o'er wrested seeming he acts thy greatness in and when he speaks tis like a chime a mending with terms unsquared which from the tongue of roaring typhon dropp'd would seem hyperboles at this fusty stuff the large achilles on his press'd bed lolling from his deep chest laughs out a loud applause cries excellent tis agamemnon just now play me nestor hem and stroke thy beard as he being drest to some oration that 's done as near as the extremest ends of parallels as like as vulcan and his wife yet god achilles still cries excellent tis nestor right now play him me patroclus arming to answer in a night alarm and then forsooth the faint defects of age must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit and with a palsy fumbling on his gorget shake in and out the rivet and at this sport sir valour dies cries o enough patroclus or give me ribs of steel i shall split all in pleasure of my spleen and in this fashion all our abilities gifts natures shapes severals and generals of grace exact achievements plots orders preventions excitements to the field or speech for truce success or loss what is or is not serves as stuff for these two to make paradoxes and in the imitation of these twain-- who as ulysses says opinion crowns with an imperial voice many are infect ajax is grown self will'd and bears his head in such a rein in full as proud a place as broad achilles keeps his tent like him makes factious feasts rails on our state of war bold as an oracle and sets thersites a slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint to match us in comparisons with dirt to weaken and discredit our exposure how rank soever rounded in with danger they tax our policy and call it cowardice count wisdom as no member of the war forestall prescience and esteem no act but that of hand the still and mental parts that do contrive how many hands shall strike when fitness calls them on and know by measure of their observant toil the enemies weight,-- why this hath not a finger 's dignity they call this bed work mappery closet war so that the ram that batters down the wall for the great swing and rudeness of his poise they place before his hand that made the engine or those that with the fineness of their souls by reason guide his execution let this be granted and achilles horse makes many thetis sons a tucket what trumpet look menelaus from troy enter aeneas what would you fore our tent is this great agamemnon 's tent i pray you even this may one that is a herald and a prince do a fair message to his kingly ears with surety stronger than achilles arm fore all the greekish heads which with one voice call agamemnon head and general fair leave and large security how may a stranger to those most imperial looks know them from eyes of other mortals how ay i ask that i might waken reverence and bid the cheek be ready with a blush modest as morning when she coldly eyes the youthful phoebus which is that god in office guiding men which is the high and mighty agamemnon this trojan scorns us or the men of troy are ceremonious courtiers courtiers as free as debonair unarm'd as bending angels that 's their fame in peace but when they would seem soldiers they have galls good arms strong joints true swords and jove 's accord nothing so full of heart but peace aeneas peace trojan lay thy finger on thy lips the worthiness of praise distains his worth if that the praised himself bring the praise forth but what the repining enemy commends that breath fame blows that praise sole sure transcends sir you of troy call you yourself aeneas ay greek that is my name what 's your affair i pray you sir pardon tis for agamemnon 's ears he hears naught privately that comes from troy nor i from troy come not to whisper him i bring a trumpet to awake his ear to set his sense on the attentive bent and then to speak speak frankly as the wind it is not agamemnon 's sleeping hour that thou shalt know trojan he is awake he tells thee so himself trumpet blow loud send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents and every greek of mettle let him know what troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud trumpet sounds we have great agamemnon here in troy a prince call'd hector,--priam is his father,-- who in this dull and long continued truce is rusty grown he bade me take a trumpet and to this purpose speak kings princes lords if there be one among the fair'st of greece that holds his honour higher than his ease that seeks his praise more than he fears his peril that knows his valour and knows not his fear that loves his mistress more than in confession with truant vows to her own lips he loves and dare avow her beauty and her worth in other arms than hers,--to him this challenge hector in view of trojans and of greeks shall make it good or do his best to do it he hath a lady wiser fairer truer than ever greek did compass in his arms and will to morrow with his trumpet call midway between your tents and walls of troy to rouse a grecian that is true in love if any come hector shall honour him if none he 'll say in troy when he retires the grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth the splinter of a lance even so much this shall be told our lovers lord aeneas if none of them have soul in such a kind we left them all at home but we are soldiers and may that soldier a mere recreant prove that means not hath not or is not in love if then one is or hath or means to be that one meets hector if none else i am he tell him of nestor one that was a man when hector 's grandsire suck'd he is old now but if there be not in our grecian host one noble man that hath one spark of fire to answer for his love tell him from me i 'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver and in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn and meeting him will tell him that my lady was fairer than his grandam and as chaste as may be in the world his youth in flood i 'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth amen fair lord aeneas let me touch your hand to our pavilion shall i lead you sir achilles shall have word of this intent so shall each lord of greece from tent to tent yourself shall feast with us before you go and find the welcome of a noble foe exeunt all but ulysses and nestor nestor what says ulysses i have a young conception in my brain be you my time to bring it to some shape what is't this tis blunt wedges rive hard knots the seeded pride that hath to this maturity blown up in rank achilles must or now be cropp'd or shedding breed a nursery of like evil to overbulk us all well and how this challenge that the gallant hector sends however it is spread in general name relates in purpose only to achilles the purpose is perspicuous even as substance whose grossness little characters sum up and in the publication make no strain but that achilles were his brain as barren as banks of libya,--though apollo knows tis dry enough,--will with great speed of judgment ay with celerity find hector 's purpose pointing on him and wake him to the answer think you yes tis most meet whom may you else oppose that can from hector bring his honour off if not achilles though't be a sportful combat yet in the trial much opinion dwells for here the trojans taste our dear'st repute with their finest palate and trust to me ulysses our imputation shall be oddly poised in this wild action for the success although particular shall give a scantling of good or bad unto the general and in such indexes although small pricks to their subsequent volumes there is seen the baby figure of the giant mass of things to come at large it is supposed he that meets hector issues from our choice and choice being mutual act of all our souls makes merit her election and doth boil as twere from us all a man distill'd out of our virtues who miscarrying what heart receives from hence the conquering part to steel a strong opinion to themselves which entertain'd limbs are his instruments in no less working than are swords and bows directive by the limbs give pardon to my speech therefore tis meet achilles meet not hector let us like merchants show our foulest wares and think perchance they 'll sell if not the lustre of the better yet to show shall show the better do not consent that ever hector and achilles meet for both our honour and our shame in this are dogg'd with two strange followers i see them not with my old eyes what are they what glory our achilles shares from hector were he not proud we all should share with him but he already is too insolent a nd we were better parch in afric sun than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes should he scape hector fair if he were foil'd why then we did our main opinion crush in taint of our best man no make a lottery and by device let blockish ajax draw the sort to fight with hector among ourselves give him allowance for the better man for that will physic the great myrmidon who broils in loud applause and make him fall his crest that prouder than blue iris bends if the dull brainless ajax come safe off we 'll dress him up in voices if he fail yet go we under our opinion still that we have better men but hit or miss our project 's life this shape of sense assumes ajax employ'd plucks down achilles plumes ulysses now i begin to relish thy advice and i will give a taste of it forthwith to agamemnon go we to him straight two curs shall tame each other pride alone must tarre the mastiffs on as twere their bone exeunt act ii scene i. a part of the grecian camp enter ajax and thersites thersites agamemnon how if he had boils full all over generally thersites and those boils did run say so did not the general run then were not that a botchy core dog then would come some matter from him i see none now thou bitch wolf 's son canst thou not hear beating him feel then the plague of greece upon thee thou mongrel beef witted lord speak then thou vinewedst leaven speak i will beat thee into handsomeness i shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness but i think thy horse will sooner con an oration than thou learn a prayer without book thou canst strike canst thou a red murrain o thy jade 's tricks toadstool learn me the proclamation dost thou think i have no sense thou strikest me thus the proclamation thou art proclaimed a fool i think do not porpentine do not my fingers itch i would thou didst itch from head to foot and i had the scratching of thee i would make thee the loathsomest scab in greece when thou art forth in the incursions thou strikest as slow as another i say the proclamation thou grumblest and railest every hour on achilles and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as cerberus is at proserpine 's beauty ay that thou barkest at him mistress thersites thou shouldest strike him cobloaf he would pun thee into shivers with his fist as a sailor breaks a biscuit beating him   you whoreson cur do do thou stool for a witch ay do do thou sodden witted lord thou hast no more brain than i have in mine elbows an assinego may tutor thee thou scurvy valiant ass thou art here but to thrash trojans and thou art bought and sold among those of any wit like a barbarian slave if thou use to beat me i will begin at thy heel and tell what thou art by inches thou thing of no bowels thou you dog you scurvy lord beating him   you cur mars his idiot do rudeness do camel do do enter achilles and patroclus why how now ajax wherefore do you thus how now thersites what 's the matter man you see him there do you ay what 's the matter nay look upon him so i do what 's the matter nay but regard him well well why i do so but yet you look not well upon him for whosoever you take him to be he is ajax i know that fool ay but that fool knows not himself therefore i beat thee lo lo lo lo what modicums of wit he utters his evasions have ears thus long i have bobbed his brain more than he has beat my bones i will buy nine sparrows for a penny and his pia mater is not worth the nineth part of a sparrow this lord achilles ajax who wears his wit in his belly and his guts in his head i 'll tell you what i say of him what i say this ajax-- ajax offers to beat him nay good ajax has not so much wit-- nay i must hold you as will stop the eye of helen 's needle for whom he comes to fight peace fool i would have peace and quietness but the fool will not he there that he look you there o thou damned cur i shall-- will you set your wit to a fool 's no i warrant you for a fools will shame it good words thersites what 's the quarrel i bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the proclamation and he rails upon me i serve thee not well go to go to i serve here voluntarily your last service was sufferance twas not voluntary no man is beaten voluntary ajax was here the voluntary and you as under an impress e'en so a great deal of your wit too lies in your sinews or else there be liars hector have a great catch if he knock out either of your brains a were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel what with me too thersites there 's ulysses and old nestor whose wit was mouldy ere your grandsires had nails on their toes yoke you like draught oxen and make you plough up the wars what what yes good sooth to achilles to ajax to i shall cut out your tongue tis no matter i shall speak as much as thou afterwards no more words thersites peace i will hold my peace when achilles brach bids me shall i there 's for you patroclus i will see you hanged like clotpoles ere i come any more to your tents i will keep where there is wit stirring and leave the faction of fools exit a good riddance marry this sir is proclaim'd through all our host that hector by the fifth hour of the sun will with a trumpet twixt our tents and troy to morrow morning call some knight to arms that hath a stomach and such a one that dare maintain i know not what tis trash farewell farewell who shall answer him i know not tis put to lottery otherwise he knew his man o meaning you i will go learn more of it exeunt scene ii troy a room in priam 's palace enter priam hector troilus paris and helenus after so many hours lives speeches spent thus once again says nestor from the greeks deliver helen and all damage else-- as honour loss of time travail expense wounds friends and what else dear that is consumed in hot digestion of this cormorant war-- shall be struck off hector what say you to't though no man lesser fears the greeks than i as far as toucheth my particular yet dread priam there is no lady of more softer bowels more spongy to suck in the sense of fear more ready to cry out who knows what follows than hector is the wound of peace is surety surety secure but modest doubt is call'd the beacon of the wise the tent that searches to the bottom of the worst let helen go since the first sword was drawn about this question every tithe soul mongst many thousand dismes hath been as dear as helen i mean of ours if we have lost so many tenths of ours to guard a thing not ours nor worth to us had it our name the value of one ten what merit 's in that reason which denies the yielding of her up fie fie my brother weigh you the worth and honour of a king so great as our dread father in a scale of common ounces will you with counters sum the past proportion of his infinite and buckle in a waist most fathomless with spans and inches so diminutive as fears and reasons fie for godly shame no marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons you are so empty of them should not our father bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons because your speech hath none that tells him so you are for dreams and slumbers brother priest you fur your gloves with reason here are your reasons you know an enemy intends you harm you know a sword employ'd is perilous and reason flies the object of all harm who marvels then when helenus beholds a grecian and his sword if he do set the very wings of reason to his heels and fly like chidden mercury from jove or like a star disorb'd nay if we talk of reason let 's shut our gates and sleep manhood and honour should have hare hearts would they but fat their thoughts with this cramm'd reason reason and respect make livers pale and lustihood deject brother she is not worth what she doth cost the holding what is aught but as tis valued but value dwells not in particular

turn not back the silks upon the merchant when we have soil'd them nor the remainder viands we do not throw in unrespective sieve because we now are full it was thought meet paris should do some vengeance on the greeks your breath of full consent bellied his sails the seas and winds old wranglers took a truce and did him service he touch'd the ports desired and for an old aunt whom the greeks held captive he brought a grecian queen whose youth and freshness wrinkles apollo 's and makes stale the morning why keep we her the grecians keep our aunt is she worth keeping why she is a pearl whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships and turn'd crown'd kings to merchants if you 'll avouch twas wisdom paris went-- as you must needs for you all cried go go,'-- if you 'll confess he brought home noble prize-- as you must needs for you all clapp'd your hands and cried inestimable!'--why do you now the issue of your proper wisdoms rate and do a deed that fortune never did beggar

madly hot that no discourse of reason nor fear of bad success in a bad cause can qualify the same why brother hector we may not think the justness of each act such and no other than event doth form it nor once deject the courage of our minds because cassandra 's mad her brain sick raptures can not distaste the goodness of a quarrel which hath our several honours all engaged to make it gracious for my private part i am no more touch'd than all priam 's sons and jove forbid there should be done amongst us such things as might offend the weakest spleen to fight for and maintain else might the world convince of levity as well my undertakings as your counsels but i attest the gods your full consent gave wings to my propension and cut off all fears attending on so dire a project for what alas can these my single arms what propugnation is in one man 's valour to stand the push and enmity of those this quarrel would excite yet i protest were i alone to pass the difficulties and had as ample power as i have will paris should ne'er retract what he hath done nor faint in the pursuit paris you speak like one besotted on your sweet delights you have the honey still but these the gall so to be valiant is no praise at all sir i propose not merely to myself the pleasures such a beauty brings with it but i would have the soil of her fair rape wiped off in honourable keeping her what treason were it to the ransack'd queen disgrace to your great worths and shame to me now to deliver her possession up on terms of base compulsion can it be that so degenerate a strain as this should once set footing in your generous bosoms there 's not the meanest spirit on our party without a heart to dare or sword to draw when helen is defended nor none so noble whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed where helen is the subject then i say well may we fight for her whom we know well the world 's large spaces can not parallel paris and troilus you have both said well and on the cause and question now in hand have glozed but superficially not much unlike young men whom aristotle thought unfit to hear moral philosophy the reasons you allege do more conduce to the hot passion of distemper'd blood than to make up a free determination twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge have ears more deaf than adders to the voice of any true decision nature craves all dues be render'd to their owners now what nearer debt in all humanity than wife is to the husband if this law of nature be corrupted through affection and that great minds of partial indulgence to their benumbed wills resist the same there is a law in each well order'd nation to curb those raging appetites that are most disobedient and refractory if helen then be wife to sparta 's king as it is known she is these moral laws of nature and of nations speak aloud to have her back return'd thus to persist in doing wrong extenuates not wrong but makes it much more heavy hector 's opinion is this in way of truth yet ne'ertheless my spritely brethren i propend to you in resolution to keep helen still for tis a cause that hath no mean dependance upon our joint and several dignities why there you touch'd the life of our design were it not glory that we more affected than the performance of our heaving spleens i would not wish a drop of trojan blood spent more in her defence but worthy hector she is a theme of honour and renown a spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds whose present courage may beat down our foes and fame in time to come canonize us for i presume brave hector would not lose so rich advantage of a promised glory as smiles upon the forehead of this action for the wide world 's revenue i am yours you valiant offspring of great priamus i have a roisting challenge sent amongst the dun and factious nobles of the greeks will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits i was advertised their great general slept whilst emulation in the army crept this i presume will wake him exeunt scene iii the grecian camp before achilles tent enter thersites solus how now thersites what lost in the labyrinth of thy fury shall the elephant ajax carry it thus he beats me and i rail at him o worthy satisfaction would it were otherwise that i could beat him whilst he railed at me sfoot i 'll learn to conjure and raise devils but i 'll see some issue of my spiteful execrations then there 's achilles a rare enginer if troy be not taken till these two undermine it the walls will stand till they fall of themselves o thou great thunder darter of olympus forget that thou art jove the king of gods and mercury lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus if ye take not that little little less than little wit from them that they have which short armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web after this the vengeance on the whole camp or rather the bone ache for that methinks is the curse dependent on those that war for a placket i have said my prayers and devil envy say amen what ho my lord achilles enter patroclus who 's there thersites good thersites come in and rail if i could have remembered a gilt counterfeit thou wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation but it is no matter thyself upon thyself the common curse of mankind folly and ignorance be thine in great revenue heaven bless thee from a tutor and discipline come not near thee let thy blood be thy direction till thy death then if she that lays thee out says thou art a fair corse i 'll be sworn and sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars amen where 's achilles what art thou devout wast thou in prayer ay the heavens hear me enter achilles who 's there thersites my lord where where art thou come why my cheese my digestion why hast thou not served thyself in to my table so many meals come what 's agamemnon thy commander achilles then tell me patroclus what 's achilles thy lord thersites then tell me i pray thee what 's thyself thy knower patroclus then tell me patroclus what art thou thou mayst tell that knowest o tell tell i 'll decline the whole question agamemnon commands achilles achilles is my lord i am patroclus knower and patroclus is a fool you rascal peace fool i have not done he is a privileged man proceed thersites agamemnon is a fool achilles is a fool thersites is a fool and as aforesaid patroclus is a fool derive this come agamemnon is a fool to offer to command achilles achilles is a fool to be commanded of agamemnon thersites is a fool to serve such a fool and patroclus is a fool positive why am i a fool make that demand of the prover it suffices me thou art look you who comes here patroclus i 'll speak with nobody come in with me thersites exit here is such patchery such juggling and such knavery all the argument is a cuckold and a whore a good quarrel to draw emulous factions and bleed to death upon now the dry serpigo on the subject and war and lechery confound all exit enter agamemnon ulysses nestor diomedes and ajax where is achilles within his tent but ill disposed my lord let it be known to him that we are here he shent our messengers and we lay by our appertainments visiting of him let him be told so lest perchance he think we dare not move the question of our place or know not what we are i shall say so to him exit we saw him at the opening of his tent he is not sick yes lion sick sick of proud heart you may call it melancholy if you will favour the man but by my head tis pride but why why let him show us the cause a word my lord takes agamemnon aside what moves ajax thus to bay at him achilles hath inveigled his fool from him who thersites he then will ajax lack matter if he have lost his argument no you see he is his argument that has his argument achilles all the better their fraction is more our wish than their faction but it was a strong composure a fool could disunite the amity that wisdom knits not folly may easily untie here comes patroclus re enter patroclus no achilles with him the elephant hath joints but none for courtesy his legs are legs for necessity not for flexure achilles bids me say he is much sorry if any thing more than your sport and pleasure did move your greatness and this noble state to call upon him he hopes it is no other but for your health and your digestion sake and after dinner 's breath hear you patroclus we are too well acquainted with these answers but his evasion wing'd thus swift with scorn can not outfly our apprehensions much attribute he hath and much the reason why we ascribe it to him yet all his virtues not virtuously on his own part beheld do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss yea like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish are like to rot untasted go and tell him we come to speak with him and you shall not sin if you do say we think him over proud and under honest in self assumption greater than in the note of judgment and worthier than himself here tend the savage strangeness he puts on disguise the holy strength of their command and underwrite in an observing kind his humorous predominance yea watch his pettish lunes his ebbs his flows as if the passage and whole carriage of this action rode on his tide go tell him this and add that if he overhold his price so much we 'll none of him but let him like an engine not portable lie under this report bring action hither this can not go to war a stirring dwarf we do allowance give before a sleeping giant tell him so i shall and bring his answer presently exit in second voice we 'll not be satisfied we come to speak with him ulysses enter you exit ulysses what is he more than another no more than what he thinks he is is he so much do you not think he thinks himself a better man than i am no question will you subscribe his thought and say he is no noble ajax you are as strong as valiant as wise no less noble much more gentle and altogether more tractable why should a man be proud how doth pride grow i know not what pride is your mind is the clearer ajax and your virtues the fairer he that is proud eats up himself pride is his own glass his own trumpet his own chronicle and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours the deed in the praise i do hate a proud man as i hate the engendering of toads yet he loves himself is't not strange aside re enter ulysses achilles will not to the field to morrow what 's his excuse he doth rely on none but carries on the stream of his dispose without observance or respect of any in will peculiar and in self admission why will he not upon our fair request untent his person and share the air with us things small as nothing for request 's sake only he makes important possess'd he is with greatness and speaks not to himself but with a pride that quarrels at self breath imagined worth holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse that twixt his mental and his active parts kingdom'd achilles in commotion rages and batters down himself what should i say he is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it cry no recovery let ajax go to him dear lord go you and greet him in his tent tis said he holds you well and will be led at your request a little from himself o agamemnon let it not be so we 'll consecrate the steps that ajax makes when they go from achilles shall the proud lord that bastes his arrogance with his own seam and never suffers matter of the world enter his thoughts save such as do revolve and ruminate himself shall he be worshipp'd of that we hold an idol more than he no this thrice worthy and right valiant lord must not so stale his palm nobly acquired nor by my will assubjugate his merit as amply titled as achilles is by going to achilles that were to enlard his fat already pride and add more coals to cancer when he burns with entertaining great hyperion this lord go to him jupiter forbid and say in thunder achilles go to him aside to diomedes   o this is well he rubs the vein of him aside to nestor   and how his silence drinks up this applause if i go to him with my armed fist i 'll pash him o'er the face o no you shall not go an a be proud with me i 'll pheeze his pride let me go to him not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel a paltry insolent fellow how he describes himself can he not be sociable the raven chides blackness i 'll let his humours blood he will be the physician that should be the patient an all men were o my mind,-- wit would be out of fashion a should not bear it so a should eat swords first shall pride carry it an twould you'ld carry half a would have ten shares i will knead him i 'll make him supple he 's not yet through warm force him with praises pour in pour in his ambition is dry to agamemnon   my lord you feed too much on this dislike our noble general do not do so you must prepare to fight without achilles why tis this naming of him does him harm here is a man but tis before his face i will be silent wherefore should you so he is not emulous as achilles is know the whole world he is as valiant a whoreson dog that shall pelter thus with us would he were a trojan what a vice were it in ajax now,-- if he were proud,-- or covetous of praise,-- ay or surly borne,-- or strange or self affected thank the heavens lord thou art of sweet composure praise him that got thee she that gave thee suck famed be thy tutor and thy parts of nature thrice famed beyond all erudition but he that disciplined thy arms to fight let mars divide eternity in twain and give him half and for thy vigour bull bearing milo his addition yield to sinewy ajax i will not praise thy wisdom which like a bourn a pale a shore confines thy spacious and dilated parts here 's nestor instructed by the antiquary times he must

often have i wished me thus wished my lord the gods grant,--o my lord what should they grant what makes this pretty abruption what too curious dreg espies my sweet lady in the fountain of our love more dregs than water if my fears have eyes fears make devils of cherubims they never see truly blind fear that seeing reason leads finds safer footing than blind reason stumbling without fear to fear the worst oft cures the worse o let my lady apprehend no fear in all cupid 's pageant there is presented no monster nor nothing monstrous neither nothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas live in fire eat rocks tame tigers thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed this is the monstruosity in love lady that the will is infinite and the execution confined that the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit they say all lovers swear more performance than they are able and yet reserve an ability that they never perform vowing more than the perfection of ten and discharging less than the tenth part of one they that have the voice of lions and the act of hares are they not monsters are there such such are not

ere they are wooed they are constant being won they are burs i can tell you they 'll stick where they are thrown boldness comes to me now and brings me heart prince troilus i have loved you night and day for many weary months why was my cressid then so hard to win hard to seem won but i was won my lord with the first glance that ever pardon me-- if i confess much you will play the tyrant i love you now but not till now so much but i might master it in faith i lie my thoughts were like unbridled children grown too headstrong for their mother see we fools why have i blabb'd who shall be true to us when we are so unsecret to ourselves but though i loved you well i woo'd you not and yet good faith i wish'd myself a man or that we women had men 's privilege of speaking first sweet bid me hold my tongue for in this rapture i shall surely speak the thing i shall repent see see your silence cunning in dumbness from my weakness draws my very soul of counsel stop my mouth and shall albeit sweet music issues thence pretty i faith my lord i do beseech you pardon me twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss i am ashamed o heavens what have i done for this time will i take my leave my lord your leave sweet cressid leave an you take leave till to morrow morning,-- pray you content you what offends you lady sir mine own company you can not shun yourself let me go and try i have a kind of self resides with you but an unkind self that itself will leave to be another 's fool i would be gone where is my wit i know not what i speak well know they what they speak that speak so wisely perchance my lord i show more craft than love and fell so roundly to a large confession to angle for your thoughts but you are wise or else you love not for to be wise and love exceeds man 's might that dwells with gods above o that i thought it could be in a woman-- as if it can i will presume in you-- to feed for aye her ramp and flames of love to keep her constancy in plight and youth outliving beauty 's outward with a mind that doth renew swifter than blood decays or that persuasion could but thus convince me that my integrity and truth to you might be affronted with the match and weight of such a winnow'd purity in love how were i then uplifted but alas i am as true as truth 's simplicity and simpler than the infancy of truth in that i 'll war with you o virtuous fight when right with right wars who shall be most right true swains in love shall in the world to come approve their truths by troilus when their rhymes full of protest of oath and big compare want similes truth tired with iteration as true as steel as plantage to the moon as sun to day as turtle to her mate as iron to adamant as earth to the centre yet after all comparisons of truth as truth 's authentic author to be cited as true as troilus shall crown up the verse and sanctify the numbers prophet may you be if i be false or swerve a hair from truth when time is old and hath forgot itself when waterdrops have worn the stones of troy and blind oblivion swallow'd cities up and mighty states characterless are grated to dusty nothing yet let memory from false to false among false maids in love upbraid my falsehood when they 've said as false as air as water wind or sandy earth as fox to lamb as wolf to heifer 's calf pard to the hind or stepdame to her son yea let them say to stick the heart of falsehood as false as cressid go to a bargain made seal it seal it i 'll be the witness here i hold your hand here my cousin 's if ever you prove false one to another since i have taken such pains to bring you together let all pitiful goers between be called to the world 's end after my name call them all pandars let all constant men be troiluses all false women cressids and all brokers between pandars say amen amen amen amen whereupon i will show you a chamber with a bed which bed because it shall not speak of your pretty encounters press it to death away and cupid grant all tongue tied maidens here bed chamber pandar to provide this gear exeunt scene iii the grecian camp before achilles tent enter agamemnon ulysses diomedes nestor ajax menelaus and calchas now princes for the service i have done you the advantage of the time prompts me aloud to call for recompense appear it to your mind that through the sight i bear in things to love i have abandon'd troy left my possession incurr'd a traitor 's name exposed myself from certain and possess'd conveniences to doubtful fortunes sequestering from me all that time acquaintance custom and condition made tame and most familiar to my nature and here to do you service am become as new into the world strange unacquainted i do beseech you as in way of taste to give me now a little benefit out of those many register'd in promise which you say live to come in my behalf what wouldst thou of us trojan make demand you have a trojan prisoner call'd antenor yesterday took troy holds him very dear oft have you often have you thanks therefore-- desired my cressid in right great exchange whom troy hath still denied but this antenor i know is such a wrest in their affairs that their negotiations all must slack wanting his manage and they will almost give us a prince of blood a son of priam in change of him let him be sent great princes and he shall buy my daughter and her presence shall quite strike off all service i have done in most accepted pain let diomedes bear him and bring us cressid hither calchas shall have what he requests of us good diomed furnish you fairly for this interchange withal bring word if hector will to morrow be answer'd in his challenge ajax is ready this shall i undertake and tis a burden which i am proud to bear exeunt diomedes and calchas enter achilles and patroclus before their tent achilles stands i the entrance of his tent please it our general to pass strangely by him as if he were forgot and princes all lay negligent and loose regard upon him i will come last tis like he 'll question me why such unplausive eyes are bent on him if so i have derision medicinable to use between your strangeness and his pride which his own will shall have desire to drink it may be good pride hath no other glass to show itself but pride for supple knees feed arrogance and are the proud man 's fees we 'll execute your purpose and put on a form of strangeness as we pass along so do each lord and either greet him not or else disdainfully which shall shake him more than if not look'd on i will lead the way what comes the general to speak with me you know my mind i 'll fight no more gainst troy what says achilles would he aught with us would you my lord aught with the general no nothing my lord the better exeunt agamemnon and nestor good day good day how do you how do you exit what does the cuckold scorn me how now patroclus good morrow ajax ha good morrow ay and good next day too exit what mean these fellows know they not achilles they pass by strangely they were used to bend to send their smiles before them to achilles to come as humbly as they used to creep to holy altars what am i poor of late tis certain greatness once fall'n out with fortune must fall out with men too what the declined is he shall as soon read in the eyes of others as feel in his own fall for men like butterflies show not their mealy wings but to the summer and not a man for being simply man hath any honour but honour for those honours that are without him as place riches favour prizes of accident as oft as merit which when they fall as being slippery standers the love that lean'd on them as slippery too do one pluck down another and together die in the fall but tis not so with me fortune and i are friends i do enjoy at ample point all that i did possess save these men 's looks who do methinks find out something not worth in me such rich beholding as they have often given here is ulysses i 'll interrupt his reading how now ulysses now great thetis son what are you reading a strange fellow here writes me that man how dearly ever parted how much in having or without or in can not make boast to have that which he hath nor feels not what he owes but by reflection as when his virtues shining upon others heat them and they retort that heat again to the first giver this is not strange ulysses the beauty that is borne here in the face the bearer knows not but commends itself to others eyes nor doth the eye itself that most pure spirit of sense behold itself not going from itself but eye to eye opposed salutes each other with each other 's form for speculation turns not to itself till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there where it may see itself this is not strange at all i do not strain at the position,-- it is familiar,--but at the author 's drift who in his circumstance expressly proves that no man is the lord of any thing though in and of him there be much consisting till he communicate his parts to others nor doth he of himself know them for aught till he behold them form'd in the applause where they 're extended who like an arch reverberates the voice again or like a gate of steel fronting the sun receives and renders back his figure and his heat   i was much wrapt in this and apprehended here immediately the unknown ajax heavens what a man is there a very horse that has he knows not what nature what things there are most abject in regard and dear in use what things again most dear in the esteem and poor in worth now shall we see to morrow-- an act that very chance doth throw upon him-- ajax renown'd o heavens what some men do while some men leave to do how some men creep in skittish fortune 's hall whiles others play the idiots in her eyes how one man eats into another 's pride while pride is fasting in his wantonness to see these grecian lords!--why even already they clap the lubber ajax on the shoulder as if his foot were on brave hector 's breast and great troy shrieking i do believe it for they pass'd by me as misers do by beggars neither gave to me good word nor look what are my deeds forgot time hath my lord a wallet at his back wherein he puts alms for oblivion a great sized monster of ingratitudes those scraps are good deeds past which are devour'd as fast as they are made forgot as soon as done perseverance dear my lord keeps honour bright to have done is to hang quite out of fashion like a rusty mail in monumental mockery take the instant way for honour travels in a strait so narrow where one but goes abreast keep then the path for emulation hath a thousand sons that one by one pursue if you give way or hedge aside from the direct forthright like to an enter'd tide they all rush by and leave you hindmost or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank lie there for pavement to the abject rear o'er run and trampled on then what they do in present though less than yours in past must o'ertop yours for time is like a fashionable host that slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand and with his arms outstretch'd as he would fly grasps in the comer welcome ever smiles and farewell goes out sighing o let not virtue seek remuneration for the thing it was for beauty wit high birth vigour of bone desert in service love friendship charity are subjects all to envious and calumniating time one touch of nature makes the whole world kin that all with one consent praise new born gawds though they are made and moulded of things past and give to dust that is a little gilt more laud than gilt o'er dusted the present eye praises the present object then marvel not thou great and complete man that all the greeks begin to worship ajax since things in motion sooner catch the eye than what not stirs the cry went once on thee and still it might and yet it may again if thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive and case thy reputation in thy tent whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late made emulous missions mongst the gods themselves and drave great mars to faction of this my privacy i have strong reasons but gainst your privacy the reasons are more potent and heroical tis known achilles that you are in love with one of priam 's daughters ha known is that a wonder the providence that 's in a watchful state knows almost every grain of plutus gold finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps keeps place with thought and almost like the gods does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles there is a mystery with whom relation durst never meddle in the soul of state which hath an operation more divine than breath or pen can give expressure to all the commerce that you have had with troy as perfectly is ours as yours my lord and better would it fit achilles much to throw down hector than polyxena but it must grieve young pyrrhus now at home when fame shall in our islands sound her trump and all the greekish girls shall tripping sing great hector 's sister did achilles win but our great ajax bravely beat down him farewell my lord i as your lover speak the fool slides o'er the ice that you should break exit to this effect achilles have i moved you a woman impudent and mannish grown is not more loathed than an effeminate man in time of action i stand condemn'd for this they think my little stomach to the war and your great love to me restrains you thus sweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton cupid shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold and like a dew drop from the lion 's mane be shook to air shall ajax fight with hector ay and perhaps receive much honour by him i see my reputation is at stake my fame is shrewdly gored o then beware those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves omission to do what is necessary seals a commission to a blank of danger and danger like an ague subtly taints even then when we sit idly in the sun go call thersites hither sweet patroclus i 'll send the fool to ajax and desire him to invite the trojan lords after the combat to see us here unarm'd i have a woman 's longing an appetite that i am sick withal to see great hector in his weeds of peace to talk with him and to behold his visage even to my full of view enter thersites a labour saved a wonder what ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself how so he must fight singly to morrow with hector and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing how can that be why he stalks up and down like a peacock,--a stride and a stand ruminates like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning bites his lip with a politic regard as who should say there were wit in this head an twould out and so there is but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint which will not show without knocking the man 's undone forever for if hector break not his neck i the combat he 'll break t himself in vain glory he knows not me i said good morrow ajax and he replies thanks agamemnon what think you of this man that takes me for the general he 's grown a very land fish language less a monster a plague of opinion a man may wear it on both sides like a leather jerkin thou must be my ambassador to him thersites who i why he 'll answer nobody he professes not answering speaking is for beggars he wears his tongue in 's arms i will put on his presence let patroclus make demands to me you shall see the pageant of ajax to him patroclus tell him i humbly desire the valiant ajax to invite the most valorous hector to come unarmed to my tent and to procure safe conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious six or seven times honoured captain general of the grecian army agamemnon et cetera do this jove bless great ajax hum i come from the worthy achilles,-- ha who most humbly desires you to invite hector to his tent,-- hum and to procure safe conduct from agamemnon agamemnon ay my lord ha what say you to't god b wi you with all my heart your answer sir if to morrow be a fair day by eleven o'clock it will go one way or other howsoever he shall pay for me ere he has me your answer sir fare you well with all my heart why but he is not in this tune is he no but he 's out o tune thus what music will be in him when hector has knocked out his brains i know not but i am sure none unless the fiddler apollo get his sinews to make catlings on come thou shalt bear a letter to him straight let me bear another to his horse for that 's the more capable creature my mind is troubled like a fountain stirr'd and i myself see not the bottom of it exeunt achilles and patroclus would the fountain of your mind were clear again that i might water an ass at it i had rather be a tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance exit act iv scene i. troy a street enter from one side aeneas and servant with a   torch from the other paris deiphobus antenor diomedes and others with torches see ho who is that there it is the lord aeneas is the prince there in person had i so good occasion to lie long as you prince paris nothing but heavenly business should rob my bed mate of my company that 's my mind too good morrow lord aeneas a valiant greek aeneas,--take his hand,-- witness the process of your speech wherein you told how diomed a whole week by days did haunt you in the field health to you valiant sir during all question of the gentle truce but when i meet you arm'd as black defiance as heart can think or courage execute the one and other diomed embraces our bloods are now in calm and so long health but when contention and occasion meet by jove i 'll play the hunter for thy life with all my force pursuit and policy and thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly with his face backward in humane gentleness welcome to troy now by anchises life welcome indeed by venus hand i swear no man alive can love in such a sort the thing he means to kill more excellently we sympathize jove let aeneas live if to my sword his fate be not the glory a thousand complete courses of the sun but in mine emulous honour let him die with every joint a wound and that to morrow we know each other well we do and long to know each other worse this is the most despiteful gentle greeting the noblest hateful love that e'er i heard of what business lord so early i was sent for to the king but why i know not his purpose meets you twas to bring this greek to calchas house and there to render him for the enfreed antenor the fair cressid let 's have your company or if you please haste there before us i constantly do think-- or rather call my thought a certain knowledge-- my brother troilus lodges there to night rouse him and give him note of our approach with the whole quality wherefore i fear we shall be much unwelcome that i assure you troilus had rather troy were borne to greece than cressid borne from troy there is no help the bitter disposition of the time will have it so on lord we 'll follow you good morrow all exit with servant and tell me noble diomed faith tell me true even in the soul of sound good fellowship who in your thoughts merits fair helen best myself or menelaus both alike he merits well to have her that doth seek her not making any scruple of her soilure with such a hell of pain and world of charge and you as well to keep her that defend her not palating the taste of her dishonour with such a costly loss of wealth and friends he like a puling cuckold would drink up the lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece you like a lecher out of whorish loins are pleased to breed out your inheritors both merits poised each weighs nor less nor more but he as he the heavier for a whore you are too bitter to your countrywoman she 's bitter to her country hear me paris for every false drop in her bawdy veins a grecian 's life hath sunk for every scruple of her contaminated carrion weight a trojan hath been slain since she could speak she hath not given so many good words breath as for her greeks and trojans suffer'd death fair diomed you do as chapmen do dispraise the thing that you

precious loss here here here he comes enter troilus ah sweet ducks o troilus troilus embracing him what a pair of spectacles is here let me embrace too o heart as the goodly saying is --o heart heavy heart why sigh'st thou without breaking where he answers again because thou canst not ease thy smart by friendship nor by speaking there was never a truer rhyme let us cast away nothing for we may live to have need of such a verse we see it we see it how now lambs cressid i love thee in so strain'd a purity that the bless'd gods as angry with my fancy more bright in zeal than the devotion which cold lips blow to their deities take thee from me have the gods envy ay ay ay ay tis too plain a case and is it true that i must go from troy a hateful truth what and from troilus too from troy and troilus is it possible and suddenly where injury of chance puts back leave taking justles roughly by all time of pause rudely beguiles our lips of all rejoindure forcibly prevents our lock'd embrasures strangles our dear vows even in the birth of our own labouring breath we two that with so many thousand sighs did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves with the rude brevity and discharge of one injurious time now with a robber 's haste crams his rich thievery up he knows not how as many farewells as be stars in heaven with distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them he fumbles up into a lose adieu and scants us with a single famish'd kiss distasted with the salt of broken tears within   my lord is the lady ready hark you are call'd some say the genius so cries come to him that instantly must die bid them have patience she shall come anon where are my tears rain to lay this wind or my heart will be blown up by the root exit i must then to the grecians no remedy a

protestation be thou true and i will see thee o you shall be exposed my lord to dangers as infinite as imminent but i 'll be true and i 'll grow friend with danger wear this sleeve and you this glove when shall i see you i will corrupt the grecian sentinels to give thee nightly visitation but yet be true o heavens be true again hear while i speak it love the grecian youths are full of quality they 're loving well composed with gifts of nature flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise how novelty may move and parts with person alas a kind of godly jealousy-- which i beseech you call a virtuous sin-- makes me afeard o heavens you love me not die i a villain then in this i do not call your faith in question so mainly as my merit i can not sing nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk nor play at subtle games fair virtues all to which the grecians are most prompt and pregnant but i can tell that in each grace of these there lurks a still and dumb discoursive devil that tempts most cunningly but be not tempted do you think i will no but something may be done that we will not and sometimes we are devils to ourselves when we will tempt the frailty of our powers presuming on their changeful potency within   nay good my lord,-- come kiss and let us part within   brother troilus good brother come you hither and bring aeneas and the grecian with you my lord will you be true who i alas it is my vice my fault whiles others fish with craft for great opinion i with great truth catch mere simplicity whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns with truth and plainness i

trojans trumpet yonder comes the troop enter hector armed aeneas troilus and other trojans with attendants hail all you state of greece what shall be done to him that victory commands or do you purpose a victor shall be known will you the knights shall to the edge of all extremity pursue each other or shall be divided by any voice or order of the field hector bade ask which way would hector have it he cares not he 'll obey conditions tis done like hector but securely done a little proudly and great deal misprizing the knight opposed if not achilles sir what is your name if not achilles nothing therefore achilles but whate'er know this in the extremity of great and little valour and pride excel themselves in hector the one almost as infinite as all the other blank as nothing weigh him well and that which looks like pride is courtesy this ajax is half made of hector 's blood in love whereof half hector stays at home half heart half hand half hector comes to seek this blended knight half trojan and half greek a maiden battle then o i perceive you re enter diomedes here is sir diomed go gentle knight stand by our ajax as you and lord aeneas consent upon the order of their fight so be it either to the uttermost or else a breath the combatants being kin half stints their strife before their strokes begin ajax and hector enter the lists they are opposed already what trojan is that same that looks so heavy the youngest son of priam a true knight not yet mature yet matchless firm of word speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd his heart and hand both open and both free for what he has he gives what thinks he shows yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty nor dignifies an impure thought with breath manly as hector but more dangerous for hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes to tender objects but he in heat of action is more vindicative than jealous love they call him troilus and on him erect a second hope as fairly built as hector thus says aeneas one that knows the youth even to his inches and with private soul did in great ilion thus translate him to me alarum hector and ajax fight they are in action now ajax hold thine own hector thou sleep'st awake thee his blows are well disposed there ajax you must no more trumpets cease princes enough so please you i am not warm yet let us fight again as hector pleases why then will i no more thou art great lord my father 's sister 's son a cousin german to great priam 's seed the obligation of our blood forbids a gory emulation twixt us twain were thy commixtion greek and trojan so that thou couldst say this hand is grecian all and this is trojan the sinews of this leg all greek and this all troy my mother 's blood runs on the dexter cheek and this sinister bounds in my father 's by jove multipotent thou shouldst not bear from me a greekish member wherein my sword had not impressure made of our rank feud but the just gods gainsay that any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother my sacred aunt should by my mortal sword be drain'd let me embrace thee ajax by him that thunders thou hast lusty arms hector would have them fall upon him thus cousin all honour to thee i thank thee hector thou art too gentle and too free a man i came to kill thee cousin and bear hence a great addition earned in thy death not neoptolemus so mirable on whose bright crest fame with her loud'st oyes cries this is he could promise to himself a thought of added honour torn from hector there is expectance here from both the sides what further you will do we 'll answer it the issue is embracement ajax farewell if i might in entreaties find success-- as seld i have the chance i would desire my famous cousin to our grecian tents tis agamemnon 's wish and great achilles doth long to see unarm'd the valiant hector aeneas call my brother troilus to me and signify this loving interview to the expecters of our trojan part desire them home give me thy hand my cousin i will go eat with thee and see your knights great agamemnon comes to meet us here the worthiest of them tell me name by name but for achilles mine own searching eyes shall find him by his large and portly size worthy of arms as welcome as to one that would be rid of such an enemy but that 's no welcome understand more clear what 's past and what 's to come is strew'd with husks and formless ruin of oblivion but in this extant moment faith and troth strain'd purely from all hollow bias drawing bids thee with most divine integrity from heart of very heart

said to some my standers by lo jupiter is yonder dealing life and i have seen thee pause and take thy breath when that a ring of greeks have hemm'd thee in like an olympian wrestling this have i seen

wanton tops do buss the clouds must kiss their own feet i must not believe you there they stand yet and modestly i think the fall of every phrygian stone will cost a drop of grecian blood the end crowns all and that old common arbitrator time will one day end it so to him we leave it most gentle and most valiant hector welcome after the general i beseech you next to feast with me and see me at

give the local wound a name and make distinct the very breach whereout hector 's great spirit flew answer me heavens it would discredit the blest gods proud man to answer such a question stand again think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly as to prenominate in nice conjecture where thou wilt hit me dead i tell thee yea wert thou an oracle to tell me so i 'd not believe thee henceforth guard thee well for i 'll not kill thee there nor there nor there but by the forge that stithied mars his helm i 'll kill thee every where yea o'er and o'er you wisest grecians pardon me this brag his

his letter for the behavior of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less therefore this letter being so excellently ignorant will breed no terror in the youth he will find it comes from a clodpole but sir i will deliver his challenge by word of mouth set upon aguecheek a notable report of valour and drive the gentleman as i know his youth will aptly receive it into a most hideous opinion of his rage skill fury and impetuosity this will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the

house and desire some conduct of the lady i am no fighter i have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valour belike this is a man of that quirk sir no his

play'd on tell me why alas malvolio this is not my writing though i confess much like the character but out of question tis maria 's hand and now i do bethink me it was she first told me thou wast mad then camest in smiling and in such forms which here were presupposed upon thee in the letter prithee be content this practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee but when we know the grounds and authors of it thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge of thine own cause good madam hear me speak and let no quarrel nor no brawl to come taint the condition of this present hour which i have wonder'd at in hope it shall not most freely i confess myself and toby set this device against malvolio here upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts we had conceived against him maria writ the letter

makes of me that i have much ado to know myself your mind is tossing on the ocean there where your argosies with portly sail like signiors and rich burghers on the flood or as it were the pageants of the sea do overpeer the petty traffickers that curtsy to them do them reverence as they fly by them with their woven wings believe me sir had i such venture forth the better part of my affections would be with my hopes abroad i should be still plucking the grass to know where sits the wind peering in maps for ports and piers and roads and every object that might make me fear misfortune to my ventures out of doubt would make me sad my wind cooling my broth would blow me to an ague when i thought what harm a wind too great at sea might do i should not see the sandy hour glass run but i should think of shallows and of flats and see my wealthy andrew dock'd in sand vailing her high top lower than her ribs to kiss her burial should i go to church and see the holy edifice of stone and

upon his merchandise believe me no i thank my fortune for it my ventures are not in one bottom trusted nor to one place nor is my whole estate upon the fortune of this present year therefore my

the world gratiano a stage where every man must play a part and mine a sad one let me play the fool with mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come and let my liver rather heat with wine than my heart cool with mortifying groans why should a man whose blood is warm within sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice by being peevish i tell thee what antonio-- i love thee and it is my love that speaks-- there are a sort of men whose visages do cream and mantle like a standing pond and do a wilful stillness entertain with purpose to be dress'd in an opinion of wisdom gravity profound conceit as who should say i am sir oracle and when i ope my lips let no dog bark o my antonio i do know of these that therefore only are reputed wise for saying nothing when i am very sure if they should speak would almost damn those ears which hearing them would call their brothers fools i 'll tell thee more of this another time but fish not with this melancholy bait for this fool gudgeon this opinion come good lorenzo fare ye well awhile i 'll end my exhortation after dinner well we will leave you then till dinner time i must be one of these same

the same to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage that you to day promised to tell me of tis not unknown to you antonio how much i have disabled mine estate by something showing a more swelling port than my faint means would grant continuance nor do i now make moan to be abridged from such a noble rate but my chief care is to come fairly off from the great debts wherein my time something too prodigal hath left me gaged to you antonio i owe the most in money and in love and from your love i have a warranty to unburden all my plots and purposes how to get clear of all the debts i owe i pray you good bassanio let me know it and if it stand as you yourself still do within the eye of honour be assured my purse my person my extremest means lie all unlock'd to your occasions in my school days when i had lost one shaft i shot his fellow of the self same flight the self same way with more advised watch to find the other forth and by adventuring both i oft found both i urge this childhood proof because what follows is pure innocence i owe you much and like a wilful youth that which i owe is lost but if you please to shoot another arrow that self way which you did shoot the first i do not doubt as i will watch the aim or to find both or bring your latter hazard back again and thankfully rest debtor for the first you know me well and herein spend but time to wind about my love with circumstance and out of doubt you do me now more wrong in making question of my uttermost than if you had made waste of all i have then do but say to me what i should do that in your knowledge may by me be done and i am prest unto it therefore speak in belmont is a lady richly left and she is fair and fairer than that word of wondrous virtues sometimes from her eyes i did receive fair speechless messages her name is portia nothing undervalued to cato 's daughter brutus portia nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth for the four winds blow in from every coast renowned suitors and her sunny locks hang on her temples like a golden fleece which makes her seat of belmont colchos strand and many jasons come in quest of her o my antonio had i but the means to hold a rival place with one of them i have a mind presages me such thrift that i should questionless be fortunate thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea neither have i money nor commodity to raise a present sum therefore go forth try what my credit can in venice do that shall be rack'd even to the uttermost to furnish thee to belmont to fair portia go presently inquire and so will i where money is and i no question make to have it of my trust or for my sake exeunt scene ii belmont a room in portia 's house enter portia and nerissa by my troth nerissa my little body is aweary of this great world you would be sweet madam if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are and yet for aught i see they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing it is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the mean superfluity comes sooner by white hairs but competency lives longer good sentences and well pronounced they would be better if well followed if to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapels had been churches and poor men 's cottages princes palaces it is a good divine that follows his own instructions i can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching the brain may devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the cripple but this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband o me the word choose i may neither choose whom i would nor refuse whom i dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father is it not hard nerissa that i can not choose one nor refuse none your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their death have good inspirations therefore the lottery that he hath devised in these three chests of gold silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who shall rightly love but what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come i pray thee over name them and as thou namest them i will describe them and according to my description level at my affection first there is the neapolitan prince ay that 's a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of his horse and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself i am much afeard my lady his mother played false with a smith then there is the county palatine he doth nothing but frown as who should say if you will not have me choose he hears merry tales and smiles not i fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth i had rather be married to a death's head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these god defend me from these two how say you by the french lord monsieur le bon god made him and therefore let him pass for a man in truth i know it is a sin to be a mocker but he why he hath a horse better than the neapolitan 's a better bad habit of frowning than the count palatine he is every man in no man if a throstle sing he falls straight a capering he will fence with his own shadow if i should marry him i should marry twenty husbands if he would despise me i would forgive him for if he love me to madness i shall never requite him what say you then to falconbridge the young baron of england you know i say nothing to him for he understands not me nor i him he hath neither latin french nor italian and you will come into the court and swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english he is a proper man 's picture but alas who can converse with a dumb show how oddly he is suited i think he bought his doublet in italy his round hose in france his bonnet in germany and his behavior every where what think you of the scottish lord his neighbour that he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he borrowed a box of the ear of the englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able i think the frenchman became his surety and sealed under for another how like you the young german the duke of saxony 's nephew very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast and the worst fall that ever fell i hope i shall make shift to go without him if he should offer to choose and choose the right casket you should refuse to perform your father 's will if you should refuse to accept him therefore for fear of the worst i pray thee set a deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be within and that temptation without i know he will choose it i will do any thing nerissa ere i 'll be married to a sponge you need not fear lady the having any of these lords they have acquainted me with their determinations which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your father 's imposition depending on the caskets if i live to be as old as sibylla i will die as chaste as diana unless i be obtained by the manner of my father 's will i am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not one among them but i dote on his very absence and i pray god grant them a fair departure do you not remember lady in your father 's time a venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither in company of the marquis of montferrat yes yes it was bassanio as i think he was so called true madam he of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon was the best deserving a fair lady i remember him well and i remember him worthy of thy praise enter a serving man how now what news the four strangers seek for you madam to take their leave and there is a forerunner come from a fifth the prince of morocco who brings word the prince his master will be here to night if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as i can bid the other four farewell i should be glad of his approach if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil i had rather he should shrive me than wive me come nerissa sirrah go before whiles we shut the gates upon one wooer another knocks at the door exeunt scene iii venice a public place enter bassanio and shylock three thousand ducats well ay sir for three months for three months well for the which as i told you antonio shall be bound antonio shall become bound well may you stead me will you pleasure me shall i know your answer three thousand ducats for three months and antonio bound your answer to that antonio is a good man have you heard any imputation to the contrary oh no no no no my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient yet his means are in supposition he hath an argosy bound to tripolis another to the indies i understand moreover upon the rialto he hath a third at mexico a fourth for england and other ventures he hath squandered abroad but ships are but boards sailors but men there be land rats and water rats water thieves and land thieves i mean pirates and then there is the peril of waters winds and rocks the man is notwithstanding sufficient three thousand ducats i think i may take his bond be assured you may i will be assured i may and that i may be assured i will bethink me may i speak with antonio if it please you to dine with us yes to smell pork to eat of the habitation which your prophet the nazarite conjured the devil into i will buy with you sell with you talk with you walk with you and so following but i will not eat with you drink with you nor pray with you what news on the rialto who is he comes here enter antonio this is signior antonio aside   how like a fawning publican he looks i hate him for he is a christian but more for that in low simplicity he lends out money gratis and brings down the rate of usance here with us in venice if i can catch him once upon the hip i will feed fat the ancient grudge i bear him he hates our sacred nation and he rails even there where merchants most do congregate on me my bargains and my well won thrift which he calls interest cursed be my tribe if i forgive him shylock do you hear i am debating of my present store and by the near guess of my memory i can not instantly raise up the gross of full three thousand ducats what of that tubal a wealthy hebrew of my tribe will furnish me but soft how many months do you desire to antonio rest you fair good signior your worship was the last man in our mouths shylock although i neither lend nor borrow by taking nor by giving of excess yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend i 'll break a custom is he yet possess'd how much ye would ay ay three thousand ducats and for three months i had forgot three months you told me so well then your bond and let me see but hear you methought you said you neither lend nor borrow upon advantage

in portia 's house enter bassanio portia gratiano nerissa and attendants i pray you tarry pause a day or two before you hazard for in choosing wrong i lose your company therefore forbear awhile there 's something tells me but it is not love i would not lose you and you know yourself hate counsels not in such a quality but lest you should not understand me well,-- and yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,-- i would detain you here some month or two before you venture for me i could teach you how to choose right but i am then forsworn so will i never be so may you miss me but if you do you 'll make me wish a sin that i had been forsworn beshrew your eyes they have o'erlook'd me and divided me one half of me is yours the other half yours mine own i would say but if mine then yours and so all yours o these naughty times put bars between the owners and their rights and so though yours not yours prove it so let fortune go to hell for it not i. i speak too long but tis to peize the time to eke it and to draw it out in length to stay you from election let me choose for as i am i live upon the rack upon the rack bassanio then confess what treason there is mingled with your love none but that ugly treason of mistrust which makes me fear the enjoying of my love there may as well be amity and life tween snow and fire as treason and my love ay but i fear you speak upon the rack where men enforced do speak anything promise me life and i 'll confess the truth well then confess and live confess and love had been the very sum of my confession o happy torment when my torturer doth teach me answers for deliverance but let me to my fortune and the caskets away then i am lock'd in one of them if you do love me you will find me out nerissa and the rest stand all aloof let music sound while he doth make his choice then if he lose he makes a swan like end fading in music that the comparison may stand more proper my eye shall be the stream and watery death bed for him he may win and what is music then then music is even as the flourish when true subjects bow to a new crowned monarch such it is as are those dulcet sounds in break of day that creep into the dreaming bridegroom 's ear and summon him to marriage now he goes with no less presence but with much more love than young alcides when he did redeem the virgin tribute paid by howling troy to the sea monster i stand for sacrifice the rest aloof are the dardanian wives with bleared visages come forth to view the issue of the exploit go hercules live thou i live with much much more dismay i view the fight than thou that makest the fray music whilst bassanio comments on the caskets to himself song tell me where is fancy bred or in the heart or in the head how begot how nourished reply reply it is engender'd in the eyes with gazing fed and fancy dies in the cradle where it lies let us all ring fancy 's knell i 'll begin it,--ding dong bell ding dong bell so may the outward shows be least themselves the world is still deceived with ornament in law what plea so tainted and corrupt but being seasoned with a gracious voice obscures the show of evil in religion what damned error but some sober brow will bless it and approve it with a text hiding the grossness with fair ornament there is no vice so simple but assumes some mark of virtue on his outward parts how many cowards whose hearts are all as false as stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins the beards of hercules and frowning mars who inward search'd have livers white as milk and these assume but valour 's excrement to render them redoubted look on beauty and you shall see tis purchased by the weight which therein works a miracle in nature making them lightest that wear most of it so are those crisped snaky golden locks which make such wanton gambols with the wind upon supposed fairness often known to be the dowry of a second head the skull that bred them in the sepulchre thus ornament is but the guiled shore to a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf veiling an indian beauty in a word the seeming truth which cunning times put on to entrap the wisest therefore thou gaudy gold hard food for midas i will none of thee nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge tween man and man but thou thou meagre lead which rather threatenest than dost promise aught thy paleness moves me more than eloquence and here choose i joy be the consequence aside   how all the other passions fleet to air as doubtful thoughts and rash embraced despair and shuddering fear and green eyed jealousy o love be moderate allay thy ecstasy in measure rein thy joy scant this excess i feel too much thy blessing make it less for fear i surfeit what find i here opening the leaden casket fair portia 's counterfeit what demi god hath come so near creation move these eyes or whether riding on the balls of mine seem they in motion here are sever'd lips parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar should sunder such sweet friends here in her hairs the painter plays the spider and hath woven a golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men faster than gnats in cobwebs but her eyes,-- how could he see to do them having made one methinks it should have power to steal both his and leave itself unfurnish'd yet look how far the substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow in underprizing it so far this shadow doth limp behind the substance here 's the scroll the continent and summary of my fortune reads you that choose not by the view chance as fair and choose as true since this fortune falls to you be content and seek no new if you be well pleased with this and hold your fortune for your bliss turn you where your lady is and claim her with a loving kiss a gentle scroll fair lady by your leave i come by note to give and to receive like one of two contending in a prize that thinks he hath done well in people 's eyes hearing applause and universal shout giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt whether these pearls of praise be his or no so thrice fair lady stand i even so as doubtful whether what i see be true until confirm'd sign'd ratified by you you see me lord bassanio where i stand such as i am though for myself alone i would not be ambitious in my wish to wish myself much better yet for you i would be trebled twenty times myself a thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich that only to stand high in your account i might in virtue beauties livings friends exceed account but the full sum of me is sum of something which to term in gross is an unlesson'd girl unschool'd unpractised happy in this she is not yet so old but she may learn happier than this she is not bred so dull but she can learn happiest of all is that her gentle spirit commits itself to yours to be directed as from her lord her governor her king myself and what is mine to you and yours is now converted but now i was the lord of this fair mansion master of my servants queen o'er myself and even now but now this house these servants and this same myself are yours my lord i give them with this ring which when you part from lose or give away let it presage the ruin of your love and be my vantage to exclaim on you madam you have bereft me of all words only my blood speaks to you in my veins and there is such confusion in my powers as after some oration fairly spoke by a beloved prince there doth appear among the buzzing pleased multitude where every something being blent together turns to a wild of nothing save of joy express'd and not express'd but when this ring parts from this finger then parts life from hence o then be bold to say bassanio 's dead my lord and lady it is now our time that have stood by and seen our wishes prosper to cry good joy good joy my lord and lady my lord bassanio and my gentle lady i wish you all the joy that you can wish for i am sure you can wish none from me and when your honours mean to solemnize the bargain of your faith i do beseech you even at that time i may be married too with all my heart so thou canst get a wife i thank your lordship you have got me one my eyes my lord can look as swift as yours you saw the mistress i beheld the maid you loved i loved for intermission no more pertains to me my lord than you your fortune stood upon the casket there and so did mine too as the matter falls for wooing here until i sweat again and sweating until my very roof was dry with oaths of love at last if promise last i got a promise of this fair one here to have her love provided that your fortune achieved her mistress is this true nerissa madam it is so you stand pleased withal and do you gratiano mean good faith yes faith my lord our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage we 'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats what and

england from lisbon barbary and india and not one vessel scape the dreadful touch of merchant marring rocks not one my lord besides it should appear that if he had the present money to discharge the jew he would not take it never did i know a creature that did bear the shape of man so keen and greedy to confound a man he plies the duke at morning and at night and doth impeach the freedom of the state if they deny him justice twenty merchants the duke himself and the magnificoes of greatest port have all persuaded with him but none can drive him from the envious plea of forfeiture of justice and his bond when i was with him i have heard him swear to tubal and to chus his countrymen that he would rather have antonio 's flesh than twenty times the value of the sum that he did owe him and i know my lord if law authority and power deny not it will go hard with poor antonio is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble the dearest friend to me the kindest man the best condition'd and unwearied spirit in doing courtesies and one in whom the ancient roman honour more appears than any that draws breath in italy what sum owes he the jew for me three thousand ducats what no more pay

forfeitures many that have at times made moan to me therefore he hates me i am sure the duke will never grant this forfeiture to hold the duke can not deny the course of law for the commodity that strangers have with us in venice if it be denied will much impeach the justice of his state since that the trade and profit of the city consisteth of all nations therefore go these griefs and losses

room in portia 's house enter portia nerissa lorenzo jessica and balthasar madam although i speak it in your presence you have a noble and a true conceit of godlike amity which appears most strongly in bearing thus the absence of your lord but if you   knew to whom you show this honour how true a gentleman you send relief how dear a lover of my lord your husband i know you would be prouder of the work than customary bounty can enforce you i never did repent for doing good nor shall not now for in companions that do converse and waste the time together whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love there must be needs a like proportion of lineaments of manners and of spirit which makes me think that this antonio being the bosom lover of my lord must needs be like my lord if it be so how little is the cost i have bestow'd in purchasing the semblance of my soul from out the state of hellish misery this comes too near the praising of myself therefore no more of it hear other things lorenzo i commit into your hands the husbandry and manage of my house until my lord 's return for mine own part i have toward heaven breathed a secret vow to live in prayer and contemplation only attended by nerissa here until her husband and my lord 's return there is a monastery two miles off and there will we abide i do desire you not to deny this imposition the which my love and some necessity now lays upon you madam with all my heart i shall obey you in all fair commands my people do already know my mind and will acknowledge you and jessica in place of lord bassanio and myself and so farewell

to venice waste no time in words but get thee gone i shall be there before thee madam i go with all convenient speed exit come on nerissa i have work in hand that you yet know not of we 'll see our husbands before they think of us shall they see us they shall nerissa but in such a habit that they shall think we are accomplished with that we lack i 'll hold thee any wager when we are both accoutred like young men i 'll prove the prettier fellow of the two and wear my dagger with the braver grace and speak between the change of man and boy with a reed voice and turn two mincing steps into a manly stride and speak of frays like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies how honourable ladies sought my love which i denying they fell sick and died i could not do withal then i 'll repent and wish for all that that i had not killed them and twenty of these puny lies i 'll tell that men shall swear i have discontinued school above a twelvemonth i have within my mind a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks which i will practise why shall we turn to men fie what a question 's that if thou wert near a lewd interpreter but come i 'll tell thee all my whole device when i

got you not that you are not the jew 's daughter that were a kind of bastard hope indeed so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me truly then i fear you are damned both by father and mother thus when i shun scylla your father i fall into charybdis your mother well you are gone both ways i shall be saved by my husband he hath made me a christian truly the more to blame he we were christians enow before e'en as many as could well live one by another this making christians will raise the price of hogs if we grow all to be pork eaters we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money enter lorenzo i 'll tell my husband launcelot what you say here he comes i shall grow jealous of you shortly launcelot if you thus get my wife into corners nay you need not fear us lorenzo launcelot and i are out he tells me flatly there is no mercy for me in heaven because i am a jew 's daughter and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth for in converting jews to christians you raise the price of pork i shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the negro 's belly the moor is with child by you launcelot it is much that the moor should be more than reason but if she be less than an honest woman she is indeed more than i took her for how every fool can play upon the word i think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots go in sirrah bid them prepare for dinner that is done sir they have all stomachs goodly lord what a wit snapper are you then bid them prepare dinner that is done too sir only cover is the word will you cover then sir not so sir neither i know my duty yet more quarrelling with occasion wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an

dost thou like the lord bassanio 's wife past all expressing it is very meet the lord bassanio live an upright life for having such a blessing in his lady he finds the joys of heaven here on earth and if on earth he do not mean it then in reason he should never come to heaven why if two gods should play some heavenly match and on the wager lay two earthly women and portia one there must be something else pawn'd with the other for the poor rude world hath not her fellow even such a husband hast thou of me as she is for a wife nay but ask my opinion too of that i will anon first let us go to dinner nay let me praise you while i have a stomach no pray thee let it serve for table talk \t then howso'er thou speak'st mong other things i shall digest it well i 'll set you forth exeunt act iv scene i. venice a court of justice enter the duke the magnificoes antonio bassanio gratiano salerio and others what is antonio here ready so please your grace i am sorry for thee thou art come to answer a stony adversary an inhuman wretch uncapable of pity void and empty from any dram of mercy i have heard your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify his rigorous course but since he stands obdurate and that no lawful means can carry me out of his envy 's reach i do oppose my patience to his fury and am arm'd to suffer with a quietness of spirit the very tyranny and rage of his go one and call the jew into the court he is ready at the door he comes my lord enter shylock make room and let him stand before our face shylock the world thinks and i think so too that thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice to the last hour of act and then tis thought thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange than is thy strange apparent cruelty and where thou now exact'st the penalty which is a pound of this poor merchant 's flesh thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture but touch'd with human gentleness and love forgive a moiety of the principal glancing an eye of pity on his losses that have of late so huddled on his back enow to press a royal merchant down and pluck commiseration of his state from brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint from stubborn turks and tartars never train'd to offices of tender courtesy we all expect a gentle answer jew i have possess'd your grace of what i purpose and by our holy sabbath have i sworn to have the due and forfeit of my bond if you deny it let the danger light upon your charter and your city 's freedom you 'll ask me why i rather choose to have a weight of carrion flesh than to receive three thousand ducats i 'll not answer that but say it is my humour is it answer'd what if my house be troubled with a rat and i be pleased to give ten thousand ducats to have it baned what are you answer'd yet some men there are love not a gaping pig some that are mad if they behold a cat and others when the bagpipe sings i the nose can not contain their urine for affection mistress of passion sways it to the mood of what it likes or loathes now for your answer as there is no firm reason to be render'd why he can not abide a gaping pig why he a harmless necessary cat why he a woollen bagpipe but of force must yield to such inevitable shame as to offend himself being offended so can i give no reason nor i will not more than a lodged hate and a certain loathing i bear antonio that i follow thus a losing suit against him are you answer'd this is no answer thou unfeeling man to excuse the current of thy cruelty i am not bound to please thee with my answers do all men kill the things they do not love hates any man the thing he would not kill every offence is not a hate at first what wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice i pray you think you question with the jew you may as well go stand upon the beach and bid the main flood bate his usual height you may as well use question with the wolf why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb you may as well forbid the mountain pines to wag their high tops and to make no noise when they are fretten with the gusts of heaven you may as well do anything most hard as seek to soften that than which what 's harder?-- his jewish heart therefore i do beseech you make no more offers use no farther means but with all brief and plain conveniency let me have judgment and the jew his will for thy three thousand ducats here is six what judgment shall i dread doing were in six parts and every part a ducat i would not draw them i would have my bond how shalt thou hope for mercy rendering none what judgment shall i dread doing no wrong you have among you many a purchased slave which like your asses and your dogs and mules you use in abject and in slavish parts because you bought them shall i say to you let them be free marry them to your heirs why sweat they under burthens let their beds be made as soft as yours and let their palates be season'd with such viands you will answer the slaves are ours so do i answer you the pound of flesh which i demand of him is dearly bought tis mine and i will have it if you deny me fie upon your law there is no force in the decrees of venice i stand for judgment answer shall i have it upon my power i may dismiss this court unless bellario a learned doctor whom i have sent for to determine this come here to day my lord here stays without a messenger with letters from the doctor new come from padua bring us the letter call the messenger good cheer antonio what man courage yet the jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood i am a tainted wether of the flock meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit drops earliest to the ground and so let me you can not better be employ'd bassanio than to live still and write mine epitaph enter nerissa dressed like a lawyer 's clerk came you from padua from bellario from both my lord bellario greets your grace presenting a letter why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly to cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh jew thou makest thy knife keen but no metal can no not the hangman 's axe bear half the keenness of thy sharp envy can no prayers pierce thee no none that thou hast wit enough to make o be thou damn'd inexecrable dog and for thy life let justice be accused thou almost makest me waver in my faith to hold opinion with pythagoras that souls of animals infuse themselves into the trunks of men thy currish spirit govern'd a wolf who hang'd for human slaughter even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet and whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam infused itself in thee for thy desires are wolvish bloody starved and ravenous till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud repair thy wit good youth or it will fall to cureless ruin i stand here for law this letter from bellario doth commend a young and learned doctor to our court where is he he attendeth here hard by to know your answer whether you 'll admit him with all my heart some three or four of you go give him courteous conduct to this place meantime the court shall hear bellario 's letter reads your grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter i am very sick but in the instant that your messenger came in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of rome his name is balthasar i acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the jew and antonio the merchant we turned o'er many books together he is furnished with my opinion which bettered with his own learning the greatness whereof i can not enough commend comes with him at my importunity to fill up your grace 's request in my stead i beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation for i never knew so young a body with so old a head i leave him to your gracious acceptance whose trial shall better publish his commendation you hear the learn'd bellario what he writes and here i take it is the doctor come enter portia dressed like a doctor of laws give me your hand come you from old bellario i did my lord you are welcome take your place are you acquainted with the difference that holds this present question in the court i am informed thoroughly of the cause which is the merchant here and which the jew antonio and old shylock both stand forth is your name shylock shylock is my name of a strange nature is the suit you follow yet in such rule that the venetian law can not impugn you as you do proceed you stand within his danger do you not ay so he says do you confess the bond i do then must the jew be merciful on what compulsion must i tell me that the quality of mercy is not strain'd it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath it is twice blest it blesseth him that gives and him that takes tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes the throned monarch better than his crown his sceptre shows the force of temporal power the attribute to awe and majesty wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings but mercy is above this sceptred sway it is enthroned in the hearts of kings it is an attribute to god himself and earthly power doth then show likest god 's when mercy seasons justice therefore jew though justice be thy plea consider this that in the course of justice none of us should see salvation we do pray for mercy and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy i have spoke thus much to mitigate the justice of thy plea which if thou follow this strict court of venice must needs give sentence gainst the merchant there my deeds upon my head i crave the law the penalty and forfeit of my bond is he not able to discharge the money yes here i tender it for him in the court yea twice the sum if that will not suffice i will be bound to pay it ten times o'er on forfeit of my hands my head my heart if this will not suffice it must appear that malice bears down truth and i beseech you wrest once the law to your authority to do a great right do a little wrong and curb this cruel devil of his will it must not be there is no power in venice can alter a decree established twill be recorded for a precedent and many an error by the same example will rush into the state it can not be a daniel come to judgment yea a daniel o wise young judge how i do honour thee i pray you let me look upon the bond here tis most reverend doctor here it is shylock there 's thrice thy money offer'd thee an oath an oath i have an oath in heaven shall i lay perjury upon my soul no not for venice why this bond is forfeit and lawfully by this the jew may claim a pound of flesh to be by him cut off nearest the merchant 's heart be merciful take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond when it is paid according to the tenor it doth appear you are a worthy judge you know the law your exposition hath been most sound i charge you by the law whereof you are a well deserving pillar proceed to judgment by my soul i swear there is no power in the tongue of man to alter me i stay here on my bond most heartily i do beseech the court to give the judgment why then thus it is you must prepare your bosom for his knife o noble judge o excellent young man for the intent and purpose of the law hath full relation to the penalty which here appeareth due upon the bond tis very true o wise and upright judge how much more elder art thou than thy looks therefore lay bare your bosom ay his breast so says the bond doth it not noble judge nearest his heart those are the very words it is so are there balance here to weigh the flesh i have them ready have by some surgeon shylock on your charge to stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death is it so nominated in the bond it is not so express'd but what of that twere good you do so much for charity i can not find it tis not in the bond you merchant have you any thing to say but little i am arm'd and well prepared give me your hand bassanio fare you well grieve not that i am fallen to this for you for herein fortune shows herself more kind than is her custom it is still her use to let the wretched man outlive his wealth to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow an age of poverty from which lingering penance of such misery doth she cut me off commend me to your honourable wife tell her the process of antonio 's end say how i loved you speak me fair in death and when the tale is told bid her be judge whether bassanio had not once a love repent but you that you shall lose your friend and he repents not that he pays your debt for if the jew do cut but deep enough i 'll pay it presently with all my heart antonio i am married to a wife which is as dear to me as life itself but life itself my wife and all the world are not with me esteem'd above thy life i would lose all

enter lorenzo and jessica the moon shines bright in such a night as this when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees and they did make no noise in such a night troilus methinks mounted the troyan walls and sigh'd his soul toward the grecian tents where cressid lay that night in such a night did thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew and saw the lion 's shadow ere himself and ran dismay'd away in such a night stood dido with a willow in her hand upon the wild sea banks and waft her love to come again to carthage in such a night medea gather'd the enchanted herbs that did renew old aeson in such a night did jessica steal from the wealthy jew and with an unthrift love did run from venice as far as belmont in such a night did young lorenzo swear he loved her well stealing her soul with

become the touches of sweet harmony sit jessica look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold there 's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st but in his motion like an angel sings still quiring to the young eyed cherubins such harmony is in immortal souls but whilst this muddy vesture of decay doth grossly close it in we can not hear it enter musicians come ho and wake diana with a hymn with sweetest touches pierce your mistress ear and draw her home with music music i am never merry when i hear sweet music the reason is your spirits are attentive for do but note a wild and wanton herd or race of youthful and unhandled colts fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud which is the hot condition of their blood if they but hear perchance a trumpet sound or any air of music touch their ears you shall perceive them make a mutual stand their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze by the sweet power of music therefore the poet did feign that orpheus drew trees stones and floods since nought so stockish hard and full of rage but music for the time doth change his nature the man that hath no music in himself nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils the motions of his spirit are dull as night and his affections dark as erebus let no such man be trusted mark the music enter portia and nerissa that light we see is burning in my hall how far that little candle throws his beams so shines a good deed in a naughty world when the moon shone we did not see the candle so doth the greater glory dim the less a substitute shines brightly as a king unto the king be by and then his state empties itself as doth an inland brook into the main of waters music hark it is your music madam of the house nothing is good i see without respect methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day silence bestows that virtue on it madam the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark when neither is attended and i think the nightingale if she should sing by day when every goose is cackling would be thought no better a musician than the wren how many things by season season'd are to their right praise and true perfection peace ho the moon sleeps with endymion and would not be awaked music ceases that is the voice or i am much deceived of portia he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo by the bad voice dear lady welcome home we have been praying for our husbands healths which speed we hope the better for our words are they return'd madam they are not yet but there is come a messenger before to signify their coming go in nerissa give order to my servants that they take no note at all of our being absent hence nor you lorenzo jessica nor you a tucket sounds your husband is at hand i hear his trumpet we are no tell tales madam fear you not this night methinks is but the daylight sick it looks a little paler tis a day such as the day is when the sun is hid enter bassanio antonio gratiano and their followers we should hold day with the antipodes if you would walk in absence of the sun let me give light but let me not be light for a light wife doth make a heavy husband and never be bassanio so for me but god sort all you are welcome home my lord i thank you madam give welcome to my friend this is the man this is antonio to whom i am so infinitely bound you should in all sense be much bound to him for as i hear he was much bound for you no more than i am well acquitted of sir you are very welcome to our house it must appear in other ways than words therefore i scant this breathing courtesy to nerissa   by yonder moon i swear you do me wrong in faith i gave it to the judge 's clerk would he were gelt that had it for my part since you do take it love so much at heart a quarrel ho already what 's the matter about a hoop of gold a paltry ring that she did give me whose posy was for all the world like cutler 's poetry upon   a knife love me and leave me not what talk you of the posy or the value you swore to me when i did give it you that you would wear it till your hour of death and that it should lie with you in your grave though not for me yet for your vehement oaths you should have been respective and have kept it gave it a judge 's clerk no god 's my judge the clerk will ne'er wear hair on 's face that had it he will an if he live to be a man ay if a woman live to be a man now by this hand i gave it to a youth a kind of boy a little scrubbed boy no higher than thyself the judge 's clerk a prating boy that begg'd it as a fee i could not for my heart deny it him you were to blame i must be plain with you to part so slightly with your wife 's first gift a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger and so riveted with faith unto your flesh i gave my love a ring and made him swear never to part with it and here he stands i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth that the world masters now in faith gratiano you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief an twere to me i should be mad at it aside   why i were best to cut my left hand off and swear i lost the ring defending it my lord bassanio gave his ring away unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed deserved it too and then the boy his clerk that took some pains in writing he begg'd mine and neither man nor master would take aught but the two rings what ring gave you my lord not that i hope which you received of me if i could add a lie unto a fault i would deny it but you see my finger hath not the ring upon it it is gone even so void is your false heart of truth by heaven i will ne'er come in your bed until i see the ring nor i in yours till i again see mine sweet portia if you did know to whom i gave the ring if you did know for whom i gave the ring and would conceive for what i gave the ring and how unwillingly i left the ring when nought would be accepted but the ring you would abate the strength of your displeasure if you had known the virtue of the ring or half her worthiness that gave the ring or your own honour to contain the ring you would not then have parted with the ring what man is there so much unreasonable if you had pleased to have defended it with any terms of zeal wanted the modesty to urge the thing held as a ceremony nerissa teaches me what to believe i 'll die for't but some woman had the ring no by my honour madam by my soul no woman had it but a civil doctor which did refuse three thousand ducats of me and begg'd the ring the which i did deny him and suffer'd him to go displeased away even he that did uphold the very life of my dear friend what should i say sweet lady i was enforced to send it after him i was beset with shame and courtesy my honour would not let ingratitude so much besmear it pardon me good lady for by these blessed candles of the night had you been there i think you would have begg'd the ring of me to give the worthy doctor let not that doctor e'er come near my house since he hath got the jewel that i loved and that which you did swear to keep for me i will become as liberal as you i 'll not deny him any thing i have no not my body nor my husband 's bed know him i shall i am well sure of it lie not a night from home watch me like argus if you do not if i be left alone now by mine honour which is yet mine own i 'll have that doctor for my bedfellow and i his clerk therefore be well advised how you do leave me to mine own protection well do you so let not me take him then for if i do i 'll mar the young clerk 's pen i am the unhappy subject of these quarrels sir grieve not you you are welcome notwithstanding portia forgive me this enforced wrong and in the hearing of these many friends i swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes wherein i see myself-- mark you but that in both my eyes he doubly sees himself in each eye one swear by your double self and there 's an oath of credit nay but hear me pardon this fault and by my soul i swear i never more will break an oath with thee i once did lend my body for his wealth which but for him that had your husband 's ring had quite miscarried i dare be bound again my soul upon the forfeit that your lord will never more break faith advisedly then you shall be his surety give him this and bid him keep it better than the other here lord bassanio swear to keep this ring by heaven it is the same i gave the doctor i had it of him pardon me bassanio for by this ring the doctor lay with me and pardon me my gentle gratiano for that same scrubbed boy the doctor 's clerk in lieu of this last night did lie with me why this is like the mending of highways in summer where the ways are fair enough what are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it speak not so grossly you are all amazed here is a letter read it at your leisure it comes from padua from bellario there you shall find that portia was the doctor nerissa there her clerk lorenzo here shall witness i set forth as soon as you and even but now

come to harbour suddenly you shall not know by what strange accident i chanced on this letter i am dumb were you the doctor and i knew you not were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold ay but the clerk that never means to do it unless he live until he be a man sweet doctor you shall be my bed fellow when i am absent then lie with my wife sweet lady you have given me life and living for here i read for certain that my ships are safely come to road how now lorenzo my clerk hath some good comforts too for you ay and i 'll give them him without a fee there do i give to you and jessica from the rich jew a special deed of gift after his death of all he dies possess'd of fair ladies you drop manna in the way of starved people it is almost morning and yet i am sure you are not satisfied of these events at full let us go in and charge us there upon inter'gatories and we will answer all things faithfully let it be so the first inter'gatory that my nerissa shall be sworn on is whether till the next night she had rather stay or go to bed now being two hours to day but were the day come i should wish it dark that i were couching with the doctor 's clerk well while i live i 'll fear no

much to prick thy finger though to wound his heart what valour were it when a cur doth grin for one to thrust his hand between his teeth when he might spurn him with his foot away it is war 's prize to take all vantages and ten to one is no impeach of valour they lay hands on york who struggles ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin so doth the cony struggle in the net so triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty so true men yield with robbers so o'ermatch'd what would your grace have done unto him now brave warriors clifford and northumberland come make him stand upon this molehill here that raught at mountains with outstretched arms yet parted but the shadow with his hand what was it you that would be england 's king was't you that revell'd in our parliament and made a preachment of your high descent where are your mess of sons to back you now the wanton edward and the lusty george and where 's that valiant crook back prodigy dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice was wo nt to cheer his dad in mutinies or with the rest where is your darling rutland look york i stain'd this napkin with the blood that valiant clifford with his rapier 's point made issue from the bosom of the boy and if thine eyes can water for his death i give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal alas poor york but that i hate thee deadly i should lament thy miserable state i prithee grieve to make me merry york what hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails that not a tear can fall for rutland 's death why art thou patient man thou shouldst be mad and i to make thee mad do mock thee thus

i do set it on putting a paper crown on his head ay marry sir now looks he like a king ay this is he that took king henry 's chair and this is he was his adopted heir but how is it that great plantagenet is crown'd so soon and broke his solemn oath as i bethink me you should not be king till our king henry had shook hands with death and will you pale your head in henry 's glory and rob his temples of the diadem now in his life against your holy oath o tis a fault too too unpardonable off with the crown and with the crown his head and whilst we breathe take time to do him dead that is my office for my father 's sake nay stay lets hear the orisons he makes she wolf of france but worse than wolves of france whose tongue more poisons than the adder 's tooth how ill beseeming is it in thy sex to triumph like an amazonian trull upon their woes whom fortune captivates but that thy face is vizard like unchanging made impudent with use of evil deeds i would assay proud queen to make thee blush to tell thee whence thou camest of whom derived were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless thy father bears the type of king of naples of both the sicils and jerusalem yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult it needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen unless the adage must be verified that beggars mounted run their horse to death tis beauty that doth oft make women proud but god he knows thy share thereof is small tis virtue that doth make them most admired the contrary doth make thee wonder'd at tis government that makes them seem divine the want thereof makes thee abominable thou art as opposite to every good as the antipodes are unto us or as the south to the septentrion o tiger 's heart wrapt in a woman 's hide how couldst thou drain the life blood of the child to bid the father wipe his eyes withal and yet be seen to bear a woman 's face women are soft mild pitiful and flexible thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless bids't thou me rage why now thou hast thy wish wouldst have me weep why now thou hast thy will for raging wind blows up incessant showers and when the rage allays the rain begins these tears are my sweet rutland 's obsequies and every drop cries vengeance for his death gainst thee fell clifford and thee false frenchwoman beshrew me but his passion moves me so that hardly can i cheque my eyes from tears that face of his the hungry cannibals would not have touch'd would not have stain'd with blood but you are more inhuman more inexorable o ten times more than tigers of hyrcania see ruthless queen a hapless father 's tears this cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy and i with tears do wash the blood away keep thou the napkin and go boast of this and if thou tell'st the heavy story right upon my soul the hearers will shed tears yea even my foes will shed fast falling tears and say alas it was a piteous deed there take the crown and with the crown my curse and in thy need such comfort come to thee as now i reap at thy too cruel hand hard hearted clifford take me from the world my soul to heaven my blood upon your heads had he been slaughter man to all my kin i should not for my life but weep with him to see how inly sorrow gripes his soul what weeping ripe my lord northumberland think but upon the wrong he did us all and that will quickly dry thy

enter edward richard and their power i wonder how our princely father scaped or whether he be scaped away or no from clifford 's and northumberland 's pursuit had he been ta'en we should have heard the news had he been slain we should have heard the news or had he scaped methinks we should have heard the happy tidings of his good escape how fares my brother why is he so sad i can not joy until i be resolved where our right valiant father is become i saw him in the battle range about and watch'd him how he singled clifford forth methought he bore him in the thickest troop as doth a lion in a herd of neat or as a bear encompass'd round with dogs who having pinch'd a few and made them cry the rest stand all aloof and bark at him so fared our father with his enemies so fled his enemies my warlike father methinks tis prize enough to be his son see how the morning opes her golden gates and takes her farewell of the glorious sun how well resembles it the prime of youth trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love dazzle mine eyes or do i see three suns three glorious suns each one a perfect sun not separated with the racking clouds but sever'd in a pale clear shining sky see see they join embrace and seem to kiss as if they vow'd some league inviolable now are they but one lamp one light one sun in this the heaven figures some event tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of i think it cites us brother to the field that we the sons of brave plantagenet each one already blazing by our meeds should notwithstanding join our lights together and over shine the earth as this the world whate'er it bodes henceforward will i bear upon my target three fair shining suns nay bear three daughters by your leave i speak it you love the breeder better than the male enter a messenger but what art thou whose heavy looks foretell some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue ah one that was a woful looker on when as the noble duke of york was slain your princely father and my loving lord o speak no more for i have heard too much say how he died for i will hear it all environed he was with many foes and stood against them as the hope of troy against the greeks that would have enter'd troy but hercules himself must yield to odds and many strokes though with a little axe hew down and fell the hardest timber'd oak by many hands your father was subdued but only slaughter'd by the ireful arm of unrelenting clifford and the queen who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite laugh'd in his face and when with grief he wept the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks a napkin steeped in the harmless blood of sweet young rutland by rough clifford slain and after many scorns many foul taunts they took his head and on the gates of york they set the same and there it doth remain the saddest spectacle that e'er i view'd sweet duke of york our prop to lean upon now thou art gone we have no staff no stay o clifford boisterous clifford thou hast slain the flower of europe for his chivalry and treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him for hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee now my soul 's palace is become a prison ah would she break from hence that this my body might in the ground be closed up in rest for never henceforth shall i joy again never o never shall i see more joy i can not weep for all my body 's moisture scarce serves to quench my furnace burning heart nor can my tongue unload my heart 's great burthen for selfsame wind that i should speak withal is kindling coals that fires all my breast and burns me up with flames that tears would quench to weep is to make less the depth of grief tears then for babes blows and revenge for me richard i bear thy name i 'll venge thy death or die renowned by attempting it his name that valiant duke hath left with thee his dukedom and his chair with me is left nay if thou be that princely eagle 's bird show thy descent by gazing gainst the sun for chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say either that is thine or else thou wert not his march enter warwick montague and their army how now fair lords what fare what news abroad great lord of warwick if we should recount our baleful news and at each word 's deliverance stab poniards in our flesh till all were told the words would add more anguish than the wounds o valiant lord the duke of york is slain o warwick warwick that plantagenet which held three dearly as his soul 's redemption is by the stern lord clifford done to death ten days ago i drown'd these news in tears and now to add more measure to your woes i come to tell you things sith then befall'n after the bloody fray at wakefield fought where your brave father breathed his latest gasp tidings as swiftly as the posts could run were brought me of your loss and his depart i then in london keeper of the king muster'd my soldiers gather'd flocks of friends and very well appointed as i thought march'd toward saint alban 's to intercept the queen bearing the king in my behalf along for by my scouts i was advertised that she was coming with a full intent to dash our late decree in parliament touching king henry 's oath and your succession short tale to make we at saint alban 's met our battles join'd and both sides fiercely fought but whether twas the coldness of the king who look'd full gently on his warlike queen that robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen or whether twas report of her success or more than common fear of clifford 's rigour who thunders to his captives blood and death i can not judge but to conclude with truth their weapons like to lightning came and went our soldiers like the night owl 's lazy flight or like an idle thresher with a flail fell gently down as if they struck their friends i cheer'd them up with justice of our cause with promise of high pay and great rewards but all in vain they had no heart to fight and we in them no hope to win the day so that we fled the king unto the queen lord george your brother norfolk and myself in haste post haste are come to join with you for in the marches here we heard you were making another head to fight again where is the duke of norfolk gentle warwick and when came george from burgundy to england some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers and for your brother he was lately sent from your kind aunt duchess of burgundy with aid of soldiers to this needful war twas odds belike when valiant warwick fled oft have i heard his praises in pursuit but ne'er till now his scandal of retire nor now my scandal richard dost thou hear for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine can pluck the diadem from faint henry 's head and wring the awful sceptre from his fist were he as famous and as bold in war as he is famed for mildness peace and prayer i know it well lord warwick blame me not tis love i bear thy glories makes me speak but in this troublous time what 's to be done shall we go throw away our coats of steel and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns numbering our ave maries with our beads or shall we on the helmets of our foes tell our devotion with revengeful arms if for the last say ay and to it lords why therefore warwick came to seek you out and therefore comes my brother montague attend me lords the proud insulting queen with clifford and the haught northumberland and of their feather many more proud birds have wrought the easy melting king like wax he swore consent to your succession his oath enrolled in the parliament and now to london all the crew are gone to frustrate both his oath and what beside may make against the house of lancaster their power i think is thirty thousand strong now if the help of norfolk and myself with all the friends that thou brave earl of march amongst the loving welshmen canst procure will but amount to five and twenty thousand why via to london will we march amain and once again bestride our foaming steeds and once again cry charge upon our foes but never once again turn back and fly ay now methinks i hear great warwick speak ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day that cries retire if warwick bid him stay lord warwick on thy shoulder will i lean and when thou fail'st as god forbid the hour!-- must edward fall which peril heaven forfend no longer earl of march but duke of york the next degree is england 's royal throne for king of england shalt thou be proclaim'd in every borough as we pass along and he that throws not up his cap for joy shall for the fault make forfeit of his head king edward valiant richard montague stay we no longer dreaming of renown but

cast their gentle looks not to the beast that would usurp their den whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick not his that spoils her young before her face who scapes the lurking serpent 's mortal sting not he that sets his foot upon her back the smallest worm will turn being trodden on and doves will peck in safeguard of their brood ambitious york doth level at thy crown thou smiling while he knit his angry brows he but a duke would have his son a king and raise his issue like a loving sire thou being a king blest with a goodly son didst yield consent to disinherit him which argued thee a most unloving father unreasonable creatures feed their young and though man 's face be fearful to their eyes yet in protection of their tender ones who hath not seen them even with those wings which sometime they have used with fearful flight make war with him that climb'd unto their nest offer their own lives in their young 's defence for shame my liege make them your precedent were it not pity

a shame were this look on the boy and let his manly face which promiseth successful fortune steel thy melting heart to hold thine own and leave thine own with him full well hath clifford play'd the orator inferring arguments of mighty force but clifford tell me didst thou never hear that things ill got had ever bad success and happy always was it for that son whose father for his hoarding went to hell i 'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind and would my father had left me no more for all the rest is held at such a rate as brings a thousand fold more care to keep than in possession and

sake lords give signal to the fight what say'st thou henry wilt thou yield the crown why how now long tongued warwick dare you speak when you and i met at saint alban 's last your legs did better service than your hands then twas my turn to fly and now tis thine you said so much before and yet you fled twas not your valour clifford drove me thence no nor your manhood that durst make you stay northumberland i hold thee reverently break off the parley for scarce i can refrain the execution of my big swoln heart upon that clifford that cruel child killer i slew thy father call'st thou him a child ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland but ere sunset i 'll make thee curse the deed have done with words my lords and hear me speak defy them then or else hold close thy lips i prithee give no limits to my tongue i am a king and privileged to speak my liege the wound that bred this meeting here can not be cured by words therefore be still then executioner unsheathe thy sword by him that made us all i am resolved that clifford 's manhood lies upon his tongue say henry shall i have my right or no a thousand men have broke their fasts to day that ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown if thou deny their blood upon thy head for york in justice puts his armour on if that be right which warwick says is right there is no wrong but every thing is right whoever got thee there thy mother stands for well i wot thou hast thy mother 's tongue but thou art neither like thy sire nor dam but like a foul mis shapen stigmatic mark'd by the destinies to be avoided as venom toads or lizards dreadful stings iron of naples hid with english gilt whose father bears the title of a king,-- as if a channel should be call'd the sea,-- shamest

fairer far than thou although thy husband may be menelaus and ne'er was agamemnon 's brother wrong'd by that false woman as this king by thee his father revell'd in the heart of france and tamed the king and made the dauphin stoop and had he match'd according to his state he might have kept that glory to this day but when he took a beggar to his bed and graced thy poor sire with his bridal day even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him that wash'd his father 's fortunes forth of france and heap'd sedition on his crown at home for what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride hadst thou been meek our title still had slept and we in pity of the gentle king had slipp'd our claim until another age but when we saw our sunshine made thy spring and that thy summer bred us no increase we set the axe to thy usurping root and though the edge hath something hit ourselves yet know thou since we have begun to strike we 'll never leave till we have hewn thee down or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods and in this resolution i defy thee not willing any longer conference since thou deniest the gentle king to speak sound trumpets let our bloody colours wave and either victory or else

gnats but to the sun and who shines now but henry 's enemies o phoebus hadst thou never given consent that phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth and henry hadst thou sway'd as kings should do or as thy father and his father did giving no ground unto the house of york they never then had sprung like summer flies i and ten thousand in this luckless realm had left no mourning widows for our death and thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace for what doth cherish weeds but gentle air and what makes robbers bold but too much lenity bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds no way to fly nor strength to hold out flight the foe is merciless and will not pity for at their hands i have deserved no pity the air hath got into my deadly wounds and much effuse of blood doth make me faint come york and richard warwick and the rest i stabb'd your fathers bosoms split my breast he faints alarum and retreat enter edward george richard montague warwick and soldiers now breathe we lords good fortune bids us pause and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks some troops pursue the bloody minded queen that led calm henry though he were a king as doth a sail fill'd with a fretting gust command an argosy to stem the waves but think you lords that clifford fled with them no tis impossible he should escape for though before his face i speak the words your brother richard mark'd him for the grave and wheresoe'er he is he 's surely dead clifford groans and dies whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave a deadly groan like life and death 's departing see who it is and now the battle 's ended if friend or foe let him be gently used revoke that doom of mercy for tis clifford who not contented that he lopp'd the branch in hewing rutland when his leaves put forth but set his murdering knife unto the root from whence that tender spray did sweetly spring i mean our princely father duke of york from off the gates of york fetch down the head your father 's head which clifford placed there instead whereof let this supply the room measure for measure must be answered bring forth that fatal screech owl to our house that nothing sung but death to us and ours now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound and his ill boding tongue no more shall speak i think his understanding is bereft speak clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life and he nor sees nor hears us what we say o would he did and so perhaps he doth tis but his policy to counterfeit because he would avoid such bitter taunts which in the time of death he gave our father if so thou think'st vex him with eager words clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace clifford repent in bootless penitence clifford devise excuses for thy faults while we devise fell tortures for thy faults thou didst love york and i am son to york thou pitied'st rutland i will pity thee where 's captain margaret to fence you now they mock thee clifford swear as thou wast wo nt what not an oath nay then the world goes hard when clifford can not spare his friends an oath i know by that he 's dead and by my soul if this right hand would buy two hour 's life that i in all despite might rail at him this hand should chop it off and with the issuing blood stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst york and young rutland could not satisfy ay but he 's dead off with the traitor 's head and rear it in the place your father 's stands and now to london with triumphant march there to be crowned england 's royal king from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france and ask the lady bona for thy queen so shalt thou sinew both these lands together and having france thy friend thou shalt not dread the scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again for though they can not greatly sting to hurt yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears first will i see the coronation and then to brittany i 'll cross the sea to effect this marriage so it please my lord even as thou wilt sweet warwick let it be for in thy shoulder do i build my seat and never will i undertake the thing wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting richard i will create thee duke of gloucester and george of clarence warwick as ourself shall do and undo as him pleaseth best let me be duke of clarence george of gloucester for gloucester 's dukedom

lay hands upon him forbear awhile we 'll hear a little more my queen and son are gone to france for aid and as i hear the great commanding warwick is thither gone to crave the french king 's sister to wife for edward if this news be true poor queen and son your labour is but lost for warwick is a subtle orator and lewis a prince soon won with moving words by this account then margaret may win him for she 's a woman to be pitied much her sighs will make a battery in his breast her tears will pierce into a marble heart the tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn and nero will be tainted with remorse to hear and see her plaints her brinish tears ay but she 's come to beg warwick to give she on his left side craving aid for henry he on his right asking a wife for edward she weeps and says her henry is deposed he smiles and says his edward is install'd that she poor wretch for grief can speak no more whiles warwick tells his title smooths the wrong inferreth arguments of mighty strength and in conclusion wins the king from her with promise of his sister and what else to strengthen and support king edward 's place o margaret thus twill be and thou poor soul art then forsaken as thou went'st forlorn say what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens more than i seem and less than i was born to a man at least for less i should not be and men may talk of kings and why not i ay but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king why so i am in mind and that 's enough but if thou be a king where is thy crown my crown is in my heart not on my head not decked with diamonds and indian stones nor to be seen my crown is called content a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy well if you be a king crown'd with content your crown content and you must be contented to go along with us for as we think you are the king king edward hath deposed and we his subjects sworn in all allegiance will apprehend you as his enemy but did you never swear and break an oath no never such an oath nor will not now where did you dwell when i was king of england here in this country where we now remain i was anointed king at nine months old my father and my grandfather were kings and you were sworn true subjects unto me and tell me then have you not broke your oaths no for we were subjects but while you were king why am i dead do i not breathe a man ah simple men you know not what you swear look as i blow this feather from my face and as the air blows it to me again obeying with my wind when i do blow and yielding to another when it blows commanded always by the greater gust such is the lightness of you common men but do not break your oaths for of that sin my mild entreaty shall not make you guilty go where you will the king shall be commanded and be you kings command and i 'll obey we are true subjects to the king king edward so would you be again to henry if he were seated as king edward is we charge you in god 's name and the king 's to go with us unto the officers in god 's name lead your king 's name be obey'd and what god will that let your king perform and what he will i humbly yield unto exeunt scene ii london the palace enter king edward iv gloucester clarence and lady grey brother of gloucester at saint alban 's field this lady 's husband sir richard grey was slain his lands then seized on by the conqueror her suit is now to repossess those lands which we in justice can not well deny because in quarrel of the house of york the worthy gentleman did lose his life your highness shall do well to grant her suit it were dishonour to deny it her it were no less but yet i 'll make a pause aside to clarence   yea is it so i see the lady hath a thing to grant before the king will grant her humble suit aside to gloucester   he knows the game how true he keeps the wind aside to clarence   silence widow we will consider of your suit and come some other time to know our mind right gracious lord i can not brook delay may it please your highness to resolve me now and what your pleasure is shall satisfy me aside to clarence   ay widow then i 'll warrant you all your lands an if what pleases him shall pleasure you fight closer or good faith you 'll catch a blow aside to gloucester   i fear her not unless she chance to fall aside to clarence god forbid that for he 'll take vantages how many children hast thou widow tell me aside to gloucester   i think he means to beg a child of her aside to clarence   nay whip me then he 'll rather give her two three my most gracious lord aside to clarence   you shall have four if you 'll be ruled by him twere pity they should lose their father 's lands be pitiful dread lord and grant it then lords give us leave i 'll try this widow 's wit aside to clarence   ay good leave have you for you will have leave till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch gloucester and clarence retire now tell me madam do you love your children ay full as dearly as i love myself and would you not do much to do them good to do them good i would sustain some harm then get your husband 's lands to do them good therefore i came unto your majesty i 'll tell you how these lands are to be got so shall you bind me to your highness service what service wilt thou do me if i give them what you command that rests in me to do but you will take exceptions to my boon no gracious lord except i can not do it ay but thou canst do what i mean to ask why then i will do what your grace commands aside to clarence   he plies her hard and much rain wears the marble aside to gloucester   as red as fire nay then her wax must melt why stops my lord shall i not hear my task an easy task tis but to love a king that 's soon perform'd because i am a subject why then thy husband 's lands i freely give thee i take my leave with many thousand thanks aside to clarence   the match is made she seals it with a curtsy but stay thee tis the fruits of love i mean the fruits of love i mean my loving liege ay but i fear me in another sense what love think'st thou i sue so much to get my love till death my humble thanks my prayers that love which virtue begs and virtue grants no by my troth i did not mean such love why then you mean not as i thought you did but now you partly may perceive my mind my mind will never grant what i perceive your highness aims at if i aim aright to tell thee plain i aim to lie with thee to tell you plain i had rather lie in prison why then thou shalt not have thy husband 's lands why then mine honesty shall be my dower for by that loss i will not purchase them therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily herein your highness wrongs both them and me but mighty lord this merry inclination accords not with the sadness of my suit please you dismiss me either with ay or no ay if thou wilt say ay to my request no if thou dost say no to my demand then no my lord my suit is at an end aside to clarence   the widow likes him not she knits her brows aside to gloucester   he is the bluntest wooer in christendom aside   her looks do argue her replete with modesty her words do show her wit incomparable all her perfections challenge sovereignty one way or other she is for a king and she shall be my love or else my queen.-- say that king edward take thee for his queen tis better said than done my gracious lord i am a subject fit to jest withal but far unfit to be a sovereign sweet widow by my state i swear to thee i speak no more than what my soul intends and that is to enjoy thee for my love and that is more than i will yield unto i know i am too mean to be your queen and yet too good to be your concubine you cavil widow i did mean my queen twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father no more than when my daughters call thee mother thou art a widow and thou hast some children and by god 's mother i being but a bachelor have other some why tis a happy thing to be the father unto many sons answer no more for thou shalt be my queen aside to clarence   the ghostly father now hath done his shrift aside to gloucester   when he was made a shriver twas for shift brothers you muse what chat we two have had the widow likes it not for she looks very sad you 'll think it strange if i should marry her to whom my lord why clarence to myself that would be ten days wonder at the least that 's a day longer than a wonder lasts by so much is the wonder in extremes well jest on brothers i can tell you both her suit is granted for her husband 's lands enter a nobleman my gracious lord henry your foe is taken and brought your prisoner to your palace gate see that he be convey'd unto the tower and go we brothers to the man that took him to question of his apprehension widow go you along lords use her honourably exeunt all but gloucester ay edward will use women honourably would he were wasted marrow bones and all that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring to cross me from the golden time i look for and yet between my soul 's desire and me-- the lustful edward 's title buried-- is clarence henry and his son young edward and all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies to take their rooms ere i can place myself a cold premeditation for my purpose why then i do but dream on sovereignty like one that stands upon a promontory and spies a far off shore where he would tread wishing his foot were equal with his eye and chides the sea that sunders him from thence saying he 'll lade it dry to have his way so do i wish the crown being so far off and so i chide the means that keeps me from it and so i say i 'll cut the causes off flattering me with impossibilities my eye 's too quick my heart o'erweens too much unless my hand and strength could equal them well say there is no kingdom then for richard what other pleasure can the world afford i 'll make my heaven in a lady 's lap and deck my body in gay ornaments and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks o miserable thought and more unlikely than to accomplish twenty golden crowns why love forswore me in my   mother 's womb and for i should not deal in her soft laws she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe to shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub to make an envious mountain on my back where sits deformity to mock my body to shape my legs of an unequal size to disproportion me in every part like to a chaos or an unlick'd bear whelp that carries no impression like the dam and am i then a man to be beloved o monstrous fault to harbour such a thought then since this earth affords no joy to me but to command to cheque to o'erbear such as are of better person than myself i 'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown and whiles i live to account this world but hell until my mis shaped trunk that bears this head be round impaled with a glorious crown and yet i know not how to get the crown for many lives stand between me and home and i,--like one lost in a thorny wood that rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns seeking a way and straying from the way not knowing how to find the open air but toiling desperately to find it out,-- torment myself to catch the english crown and from that torment i will free myself or hew my way out with a bloody axe why i can smile and murder whiles i smile and cry content to that which grieves my heart and wet my cheeks with artificial tears and frame my face to all occasions i 'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall i 'll slay more gazers than the basilisk i 'll play the orator as well as nestor deceive more slily than ulysses could and like a sinon take another troy i can add colours to the chameleon change shapes with proteus for advantages and set the murderous machiavel to school can i do this and can not get a crown tut were it farther off i 'll pluck it down exit scene iii france king lewis xi 's palace flourish enter king lewis xi his sister bona   his admiral called bourbon prince edward queen   margaret and oxford king lewis xi sits and riseth up again fair queen of england worthy margaret sit down with us it ill befits thy state and birth that thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit no mighty king of france now margaret must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve where kings command i was i must confess great albion 's queen in former golden days but now mischance hath trod my title down and with dishonour laid me on the ground where i must take like seat unto my fortune and to my humble seat conform myself why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears and stops my tongue while heart is drown'd in cares whate'er it be be thou still like thyself and sit thee by our side seats her by him yield not thy neck to fortune 's yoke but let thy dauntless mind still ride in triumph over all mischance be plain queen margaret and tell thy grief it shall be eased if france can yield relief those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts and give my tongue tied sorrows leave to speak now therefore be it known to noble lewis that henry sole possessor of my love is of a king become a banish'd man and forced to live in scotland a forlorn while proud ambitious edward duke of york usurps the regal title and the seat of england 's true anointed lawful king this is the cause that i poor margaret with this my son prince edward henry 's heir am come to crave thy just and lawful aid and if thou fail us all our hope is done scotland hath will to help but can not help our people and our peers are both misled our treasures seized our soldiers put to flight and as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight renowned queen with patience calm the storm while we bethink a means to break it off the more we stay the stronger grows our foe the more i stay the more i 'll succor thee o but impatience waiteth on true sorrow and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow enter warwick what 's he approacheth boldly to our presence our earl of warwick edward 's greatest friend welcome brave warwick what brings thee to france he descends she ariseth ay now begins a second storm to rise for this is he that moves both wind and tide from worthy edward king of albion my lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend i come in kindness and unfeigned love first to do greetings to thy royal person and then to crave a league of amity and lastly to confirm that amity with a nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant that virtuous lady bona thy fair sister to england 's king in lawful marriage aside   if that go forward henry 's hope is done to bona   and gracious madam in our king 's behalf i am commanded with your leave and favour humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue to tell the passion of my sovereign 's heart where fame late entering at his heedful ears hath placed thy beauty 's image and thy virtue king lewis and lady bona hear me speak before you answer warwick his demand springs not from edward 's well meant honest love but from deceit bred by necessity for how can tyrants safely govern home unless abroad they purchase great alliance to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice that henry liveth still but were he dead yet here prince edward stands king henry 's son look therefore lewis that by this league and marriage thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour for though usurpers sway the rule awhile yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs injurious margaret and why not queen because thy father henry did usurp and thou no more are prince than she is queen then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt which did subdue the greatest part of spain and after john of gaunt henry the fourth whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest and after that wise prince henry the fifth who by his prowess conquered all france from these our henry lineally descends oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse you told not how henry the sixth hath lost all that which henry fifth had gotten methinks these peers of france should smile at that but for the rest you tell a pedigree of threescore and two years a silly time to make prescription for a kingdom 's worth why warwick canst thou speak against thy liege whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years and not bewray thy treason with a blush can oxford that did ever fence the right now buckler falsehood with a pedigree for shame leave henry and call edward king call him my king by whose injurious doom my elder brother the lord aubrey vere was done to death and more than so my father even in the downfall of his mellow'd years when nature brought him to the door of death no warwick no while life upholds this arm this arm upholds the house of lancaster and i the house of york queen margaret prince edward and oxford vouchsafe at our request to stand aside while i use further conference with warwick they stand aloof heavens grant that warwick 's words bewitch him not now warwick tell me even upon thy conscience is edward your true king for i were loath to link with him that were not lawful chosen thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour but is he gracious in the people 's eye the more that henry was unfortunate then further all dissembling set aside tell me for truth the measure of his love unto our sister bona such it seems as may beseem a monarch like himself myself have often heard him say and swear that this his love was an eternal plant whereof the root was fix'd in virtue 's ground the leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty 's sun exempt from envy but not from disdain unless the lady bona quit his pain now sister let us hear your firm resolve your grant or your denial shall be mine to warwick yet i confess that often ere this day when i have heard your king 's desert recounted mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire then warwick thus our sister shall be edward 's and now forthwith shall articles be drawn touching the jointure that your king must make which with her dowry shall be counterpoised draw near queen margaret and be a witness that bona shall be wife to the english king to edward but not to the english king deceitful warwick it was thy device by this alliance to make void my suit before thy coming lewis was henry 's friend and still is friend to him and margaret but if your title to the crown be weak as may appear by edward 's good success then tis but reason that i be released from giving aid which late i promised yet shall you have all kindness at my hand that your estate requires and mine can yield henry now lives in scotland at his ease where having nothing nothing can he lose and as for you yourself our quondam queen you have a father able to maintain you and better twere you troubled him than france peace impudent and shameless warwick peace proud setter up and puller down of kings i will not hence till with my talk and tears both full of truth i make king lewis behold thy sly conveyance and thy lord 's false love for both of you are birds of selfsame feather post blows a horn within warwick this is some post to us or thee enter a post to warwick   my lord ambassador these letters are for you sent from your brother marquess montague to king lewis xi these from our king unto your majesty to queen margaret and madam these for you from whom i know not they all read their letters i like it well that our fair queen and mistress smiles at her news while warwick frowns at his nay mark how lewis stamps as he were nettled i hope all 's for the best warwick what are thy news and yours fair queen mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys mine full of sorrow and heart 's discontent what has your king married the lady grey and now to soothe your forgery and his sends me a paper to persuade me patience is this the alliance that he seeks with france dare he presume to scorn us in this manner i told your majesty as much before this proveth edward 's love and warwick 's honesty king lewis i here protest in sight of heaven and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss that i am clear from this misdeed of edward 's no more my king for he dishonours me but most himself if he could see his shame did i forget that by the house of york my father came untimely to his death did i let pass the abuse done to my niece did i impale him with the regal crown did i put henry from his native right and am i guerdon'd at the last with shame shame on himself for my desert is honour and to repair my honour lost for him i here renounce him and return to henry my noble queen let former grudges pass and henceforth i am thy true servitor i will revenge his wrong to lady bona and replant henry in his former state warwick these words have turn'd my hate to love and i forgive and quite forget old faults and joy that thou becomest king henry 's friend so much his friend ay his unfeigned friend that if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us with some few bands of chosen soldiers i 'll undertake to land them on our coast and force the tyrant from his seat by war tis not his new made bride shall succor him and as for clarence as my letters tell me he 's very likely now to fall from him for matching more for wanton lust than honour or than for strength and safety of our country dear brother how shall bona be revenged but by thy help to this distressed queen renowned prince how shall poor henry live unless thou rescue him from foul despair my quarrel and this english queen 's are one and mine fair lady bona joins with yours and mine with hers and thine and margaret 's therefore at last i firmly am resolved you shall have aid let me give humble thanks for all at once then england 's messenger return in post and tell false edward thy supposed king that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride thou seest what 's past go fear thy king withal tell him in hope he 'll prove a widower shortly i 'll wear the willow garland for his sake tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside and i am ready to put armour on tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore i 'll uncrown him ere't be long there 's thy reward be gone exit post but warwick thou and oxford with five thousand men shall cross the seas and bid false edward battle and as occasion serves this noble queen and prince shall follow with a fresh supply yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty this shall assure my constant loyalty that if our queen and this young prince agree i 'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands yes i agree and thank you for your motion son edward she is fair and virtuous therefore delay not give thy hand to warwick and with thy hand thy faith irrevocable that only warwick 's daughter shall be thine yes i accept her for she well deserves it and here to pledge my vow i give my hand he gives his hand to warwick why stay we now these soldiers shall be levied and thou lord bourbon our high admiral shalt waft them over with our royal fleet i long till edward fall by war 's mischance for mocking marriage with a dame of france exeunt all but warwick i came from edward as ambassador but i return his sworn and mortal foe matter of marriage was the charge he gave me but dreadful war shall answer his demand had he none else to make a stale but me then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow i was the chief that raised him to the crown and i 'll be chief to bring him down again not that i pity henry 's misery but seek revenge on edward 's mockery exit act iv scene i. london the palace enter gloucester clarence somerset and montague now tell me brother clarence what think you of this new marriage with the lady grey hath not our brother made a worthy choice alas you know tis far from hence to france how could he stay till warwick made return my lords forbear this talk here comes the king and his well chosen bride i mind to tell him plainly what i think flourish enter king edward iv attended queen elizabeth pembroke stafford hastings and others now brother of clarence how like you our choice that you stand pensive as half malcontent as well as lewis of france or the earl of warwick which are so weak of courage and in judgment that they 'll take no offence at our abuse suppose they take offence without a cause they are but lewis and warwick i am edward your king and warwick 's and must have my will and shall have your will because our king yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well yea brother richard are you offended too not i no god forbid that i should wish them sever'd whom god hath join'd together ay and twere pity to sunder them that yoke so well together setting your scorns and your mislike aside tell me some reason why the lady grey should not become my wife and england 's queen and you too somerset and montague speak freely what you think then this is mine opinion that king lewis becomes your enemy for mocking him about the marriage of the lady bona and warwick doing what you gave in charge is now dishonoured by this new marriage what if both lewis and warwick be appeased by such invention as i can devise yet to have join'd with france in such alliance would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth gainst foreign storms than any home bred marriage why knows not montague that of itself england is safe if true within itself but the safer when tis back'd with france tis better using france than trusting france let us be back'd with god and with the seas which he hath given for fence impregnable and with their helps only defend ourselves in them and in ourselves our safety lies for this one speech lord hastings well deserves to have the heir of the lord hungerford ay what of that it was my will and grant and for this once my will shall stand for law and yet methinks your grace hath not done well to give the heir and daughter of lord scales unto the brother of your loving bride she better would have fitted me or clarence but in your bride you bury brotherhood or else you would not have bestow'd the heir of the lord bonville on your new wife 's son and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere alas poor clarence is it for a wife that thou art malcontent i will provide thee in choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment which being shallow you give me leave to play the broker in mine own behalf and to that end i shortly mind to leave you leave me or tarry edward will be king and not be tied unto his brother 's will my lords before it pleased his majesty to raise my state to title of a queen do me but right and you must all confess that i was not ignoble of descent and meaner than myself have had like fortune but as this title honours me and mine so your dislike to whom i would be pleasing doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow my love forbear to fawn upon their frowns what danger or what sorrow can befall thee so long as edward is thy constant friend and their true sovereign whom they must obey nay whom they shall obey and love thee too unless they seek for hatred at my hands which if they do yet will i keep thee safe and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath aside   i hear yet say not much but think the more enter a post now messenger what letters or what news from france my sovereign liege no letters and few words but such as i without your special pardon dare not relate go to we pardon thee therefore in brief tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them what answer makes king lewis unto our letters at my depart these were his very words go tell false edward thy supposed king that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride is lewis so brave belike he thinks me henry but what said lady bona to my marriage these were her words utter'd with mad disdain tell him in hope he 'll prove a widower shortly i 'll wear the willow garland for his sake i blame not her she could say little less she had the wrong but what said henry 's queen for i have heard that she was there in place tell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done and i am ready to put armour on belike she minds to play the amazon but what said warwick to these injuries he more incensed against your majesty than all the rest discharged me with these words tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore i 'll uncrown him ere't be long ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words well i will arm me being thus forewarn'd they shall have wars and pay for their presumption but say is warwick friends with margaret ay gracious sovereign they are so link'd in friendship that young prince edward marries warwick 's daughter belike the elder clarence will have the younger now brother king farewell and sit you fast for i will hence to warwick 's other daughter that though i want a kingdom yet in marriage i may not prove inferior to yourself you that love me and warwick follow me exit clarence and somerset follows aside   not i my thoughts aim at a further matter i stay not for the love of edward but the crown clarence and somerset both gone to warwick yet am i arm'd against the worst can happen and haste is needful in this desperate case pembroke and stafford you in our behalf go levy men and make prepare for war they are already or quickly will be landed myself in person will straight follow you exeunt pembroke and stafford but ere i go hastings and montague resolve my doubt you twain of all the rest are near to warwick by blood and by alliance tell me if you love warwick more than me if it be so then both depart to him i rather wish you foes than hollow friends but if you mind to hold your true obedience give me assurance with some friendly vow that i may never have you in suspect so god help montague as he proves true and hastings as he favours edward 's cause now brother richard will you stand by us ay in despite of all that shall withstand you why so then am i sure of victory now therefore let us hence and lose no hour till we meet warwick with his foreign power exeunt scene ii a plain in warwickshire enter warwick and oxford with french soldiers trust me my lord all hitherto goes well the common people by numbers swarm to us enter clarence and somerset but see where somerset and clarence come speak suddenly my lords are we all friends fear not that my lord then gentle clarence welcome unto warwick and welcome somerset i hold it cowardice to rest mistrustful where a noble heart hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love else might i think that clarence edward 's brother were but a feigned friend to our proceedings but welcome sweet clarence my daughter shall be thine and now what rests but in night 's coverture thy brother being carelessly encamp'd his soldiers lurking in the towns about and but attended by a simple guard we may surprise and take him at our pleasure our scouts have found the adventure very easy that as ulysses and stout diomede with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus tents and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds so we well cover'd with the night 's black mantle at unawares may beat down edward 's guard and seize himself i say not slaughter him for i intend but only to surprise him you that will follow me to this attempt applaud the name of henry with your leader they all cry henry why then let 's on our way in silent sort for warwick and his friends god and saint george exeunt scene iii edward 's camp near warwick enter three watchmen to guard king edward iv 's tent come on my masters each man take his stand the king by this is set him down to sleep what will he not to bed why no for he hath made a solemn vow never to lie and take his natural rest till warwick or himself be quite suppress'd to morrow then belike shall be the day if warwick be so near as men report but say i pray what nobleman is that that with the king here resteth in his tent tis the lord hastings the king 's chiefest friend o is it so but why commands the king that his chief followers lodge in towns about him while he himself keeps in the cold field tis the more honour because more dangerous ay but give me worship and quietness i like it better than a dangerous honour if warwick knew in what estate he stands tis to be doubted he would waken him unless our halberds did shut up his passage ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent but to defend his person from night foes enter warwick clarence oxford somerset and french soldiers silent all this is his tent and see where stand his guard courage my masters honour now or never but follow me and edward shall be ours who goes there stay or thou diest warwick and the rest cry all warwick warwick   and set upon the guard who fly crying arm arm warwick and the rest following them the drum playing and trumpet sounding reenter   warwick somerset and the rest bringing king   edward iv out in his gown sitting in a chair richard and hastings fly over the stage what are they that fly there richard and hastings let them go here is the duke the duke why warwick when we parted thou call'dst me king ay but the case is alter'd when you disgraced me in my embassade then i degraded you from being king and come now to create you duke of york alas how should you govern any kingdom that know not how to use ambassadors nor how to be contented with one wife nor how to use your brothers brotherly nor how to study for the people 's welfare nor how to shroud yourself from enemies yea brother of clarence are thou here too nay then i see that edward needs must down yet warwick in despite of all mischance of thee thyself and all thy complices edward will always bear himself as king though fortune 's malice overthrow my state my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel then for his mind be edward england 's king takes off his crown but henry now shall wear the english crown and be true king indeed thou but the shadow my lord of somerset at my request see that forthwith duke edward be convey'd unto my brother archbishop of york when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows i 'll follow you and tell what answer lewis and the lady bona send to him now for a while farewell good duke of york they lead him out forcibly what fates impose that men must needs abide it boots not to resist both wind and tide exit guarded what now remains my lords for us to do but march to london with our soldiers ay that 's the first thing that we have to do to free king henry from imprisonment and see him seated in the regal throne exeunt scene iv london the palace enter queen elizabeth and rivers madam what makes you in this sudden change why brother rivers are you yet to learn what late misfortune is befall'n king edward what loss of some pitch'd battle against warwick no but the loss of his own royal person then is my sovereign slain ay almost slain for he is taken prisoner either betray'd by falsehood of his guard or by his foe surprised at unawares and as i further have to understand is new committed to the bishop of york fell warwick 's brother and by that our foe these news i must confess are full of grief yet gracious madam bear it as you may warwick may lose that now hath won the day till then fair hope must hinder life 's decay and i the rather wean me from despair for love of edward 's offspring in my womb this is it that makes me bridle passion and bear with mildness my misfortune 's cross ay ay for this i draw in many a tear and stop the rising of blood sucking sighs lest with my sighs or tears i blast or drown king edward 's fruit true heir to the english crown but madam where is warwick then become i am inform'd that he comes towards london to set the crown once more on henry 's head guess thou the rest king edward 's friends must down but to prevent the tyrant 's violence,-- for trust not him that hath once broken faith,-- i 'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary to save at least the heir of edward 's right there shall i rest secure from force and fraud come therefore let us fly while we may fly if warwick take us we are sure to die exeunt scene v. a park near middleham castle in yorkshire enter gloucester hastings and stanley now my lord hastings and sir william stanley leave off to wonder why i drew you hither into this chiefest thicket of the park thus stands the case you know our king my brother is prisoner to the bishop here at whose hands he hath good usage and great liberty and often but attended with weak guard comes hunting this way to disport himself i have advertised him by secret means that if about this hour he make his way under the colour of his usual game he shall here find his friends with horse and men to set him free from his captivity enter king edward iv and a huntsman with him this way my lord for this way lies the game nay this way man see where the huntsmen stand now brother of gloucester lord hastings and the rest stand you thus close to steal the bishop 's deer brother the time and case requireth haste your horse stands ready at the park corner but whither shall we then to lynn my lord and ship from thence to flanders well guess'd believe me for that was my meaning stanley i will requite thy forwardness but wherefore stay we tis no time to talk huntsman what say'st thou wilt thou go along better do so than tarry and be hang'd come then away let 's ha no more ado bishop farewell shield thee from warwick 's frown and pray that i may repossess the crown exeunt scene vi london the tower flourish enter king henry vi clarence warwick   somerset henry of richmond oxford montague and lieutenant of the tower master lieutenant now that god and friends have shaken edward from the regal seat and turn'd my captive state to liberty my fear to hope my sorrows unto joys at our enlargement what are thy due fees subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns but if an humble prayer may prevail i then crave pardon of your majesty for what lieutenant for well using me nay be thou sure i 'll well requite thy kindness for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure ay such a pleasure as incaged birds conceive when after many moody thoughts at last by notes of household harmony they quite forget their loss of liberty but warwick after god thou set'st me free and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee he was the author thou the instrument therefore that i may conquer fortune 's spite by living low where fortune can not hurt me and that the people of this blessed land may not be punish'd with my thwarting stars warwick although my head still wear the crown i here resign my government to thee for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds your grace hath still been famed for virtuous and now may seem as wise as virtuous by spying and avoiding fortune 's malice for few men rightly temper with the stars yet in this one thing let me blame your grace for choosing me when clarence is in place no warwick thou art worthy of the sway to whom the heavens in thy nativity adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown as likely to be blest in peace and war and therefore i yield thee my free consent and i choose clarence only for protector warwick and clarence give me both your hands now join your hands and with your hands your hearts that no dissension hinder government i make you both protectors of this land while i myself will lead a private life and in devotion spend my latter days to sin 's rebuke and my creator 's praise what answers clarence to his sovereign 's will that he consents if warwick yield consent for on thy fortune i repose myself why then though loath yet must i be content we 'll yoke together like a double shadow to henry 's body and supply his place i mean in bearing weight of government while he enjoys the honour and his ease and clarence now then it is more than needful forthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor and all his lands and goods be confiscate what else and that succession be determined ay therein clarence shall not want his part but with the first of all your chief affairs let me entreat for i command no more that margaret your queen and my son edward be sent for to return from france with speed for till i see them here by doubtful fear my joy of liberty is half eclipsed it shall be done my sovereign with all speed my lord of somerset what youth is that of whom you seem to have so tender care my liege it is young henry earl of richmond come hither england 's hope lays his hand on his head if secret powers suggest but truth to my divining thoughts this pretty lad will prove our country 's bliss his looks are full of peaceful majesty his head by nature framed to wear a crown his hand to wield a sceptre and himself likely in time to bless a regal throne make much of him my lords for this is he must help you more than you are hurt by me enter a post what news my friend that edward is escaped from your brother and fled as he hears since to burgundy unsavoury news but how made he escape he was convey'd by richard duke of gloucester and the lord hastings who attended him in secret ambush on the forest side and from the bishop 's huntsmen rescued him for hunting was his daily exercise my brother was too careless of his charge but let us hence my sovereign to provide a salve for any sore that may betide exeunt all but somerset henry of richmond and oxford my lord i like not of this flight of edward 's for doubtless burgundy will yield him help and we shall have more wars before t be long as henry 's late presaging prophecy did glad my heart with hope of this young richmond so doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts what may befall him to his harm and ours therefore lord oxford to prevent the worst forthwith we 'll send him hence to brittany till storms be past of civil enmity ay for if edward repossess the crown tis like that richmond with the rest shall down it shall be so he shall to brittany come therefore let 's about it speedily exeunt scene vii before york flourish enter king edward iv gloucester hastings and soldiers now brother richard lord hastings and the rest yet thus far fortune maketh us amends and says that once more i shall interchange my waned state for henry 's regal crown well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas and brought desired help from burgundy what then remains we being thus arrived from ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york but that we enter as into our dukedom the gates made fast brother i like not this for many men that stumble at the threshold are well foretold that danger lurks within tush man abodements must not now affright us by fair or foul means we must enter in for hither will our friends repair to us my liege i 'll knock once more to summon them enter on the walls the mayor of york and his brethren my lords we were forewarned of your coming and shut the gates for safety of ourselves for now we owe allegiance unto henry but master mayor if henry be your king yet edward at the least is duke of york true my good lord i know you for no less why and i challenge nothing but my dukedom as being well content with that alone aside   but when the fox hath once got in his nose he 'll soon find means to make the body follow why master mayor why stand you in a doubt open the gates we are king henry 's friends ay say you so the gates shall then be open'd they descend a wise stout captain and soon persuaded the good old man would fain that all were well so twere not long of him but being enter'd i doubt not i but we shall soon persuade both him and all his brothers unto reason enter the mayor and two aldermen below so master mayor these gates must not be shut but in the night or in the time of war what fear not man but yield me up the keys takes his keys for edward will defend the town and thee and all those friends that deign to follow me march enter montgomery with drum and soldiers brother this is sir john montgomery our trusty friend unless i be deceived welcome sir john but why come you in arms to help king edward in his time of storm as every loyal subject ought to do thanks good montgomery but we now forget our title to the crown and only claim our dukedom till god please to send the rest then fare you well for i will hence again i came to serve a king and not a duke drummer strike up and let us march away the drum begins to march nay stay sir john awhi le and we 'll debate by what safe means the crown may be recover'd what talk you of debating in few words if you 'll not here proclaim yourself our king i 'll leave you to your fortune and be gone to keep them back that come to succor you why shall we fight if you pretend no title why brother wherefore stand you on nice points when we grow stronger then we 'll make our claim till then tis wisdom to conceal our meaning away with scrupulous wit now arms must rule and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns brother we will proclaim you out of hand the bruit thereof will bring you many friends then be it as you will for tis my right and henry but usurps the diadem ay now my sovereign speaketh like himself and now will i be edward 's champion sound trumpet edward shall be here proclaim'd come fellow soldier make thou proclamation flourish edward the fourth by the grace of god king of england and france and lord of ireland   and c. and whosoe'er gainsays king edward 's right by this i challenge him to single fight throws down his gauntlet long live edward the fourth thanks brave montgomery and thanks unto you all if fortune serve me i 'll requite this kindness now for this night let 's harbour here in york and when the morning sun shall raise his car above the border of this horizon we 'll forward towards warwick and his mates for well i wot that henry is no soldier ah froward clarence how evil it beseems thee to flatter henry and forsake thy brother yet as we may we 'll meet both thee and warwick come

hector and my troy 's true hope in sign of truth i kiss your highness hand well minded clarence be thou fortunate comfort my lord and so i take my leave and thus i seal my truth and bid adieu sweet oxford and my loving montague and all at once once more a happy farewell farewell sweet lords let 's meet at coventry exeunt all but king henry vi and exeter here at the palace i will rest awhile cousin of exeter what thinks your lordship methinks the power that edward hath in field should not be able to encounter mine the doubt is that he will seduce the rest that 's not my fear my meed hath got me fame i have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands nor posted off their suits with slow delays my pity hath been balm to heal their wounds my mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs my mercy dried their water flowing tears i have not been desirous of their wealth nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies nor forward of revenge though they much err'd then why should they love edward more than me no exeter these graces challenge grace and when the lion fawns upon the lamb the lamb will never cease to follow him shout within a lancaster a lancaster hark hark my lord what shouts are these enter king edward iv gloucester and soldiers seize on the shame faced henry bear him hence and once again proclaim us king of england you are the fount that makes small brooks to flow

thy knee call edward king and at his hands beg mercy and he shall pardon thee these outrages nay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own call warwick patron and be penitent and thou shalt still remain the duke of york i thought at least he would have said the king or did he make the jest against his will is not a dukedom sir a goodly gift ay by my faith for a poor earl to give i 'll do thee service for so good a gift twas i that gave the kingdom to thy brother why then tis mine if but by warwick 's gift thou art no atlas for so great a weight and weakling warwick takes his gift again and henry is my king warwick his subject but warwick 's king is edward 's prisoner and gallant warwick do but answer this what is the body when the head is off alas that warwick had no more forecast but whiles he thought to steal the single ten the king was slily finger'd from the deck you left poor henry at the bishop 's palace and ten to one you 'll meet

infamy at thee i will not ruinate my father 's house who gave his blood to lime the stones together and set up lancaster why trow'st thou warwick that clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural to bend the fatal instruments of war against his brother and his lawful king perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath to keep that oath were more impiety than jephthah 's when he sacrificed his daughter i am so sorry for my trespass made that to deserve well at my brother 's hands i here proclaim myself thy mortal foe with resolution wheresoe'er i meet thee-- as i will meet thee if thou stir abroad-- to

i seek for thee that warwick 's bones may keep thine company exit ah who is nigh come to me friend or foe and tell me who is victor york or warwick why ask i that my mangled body shows my blood my want of strength my sick heart shows that i must yield my body to the earth and by my fall the conquest to my foe thus yields the cedar to the axe 's edge whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle under whose shade the ramping lion slept whose top branch overpeer'd jove 's spreading tree and kept low shrubs from winter 's powerful wind these eyes that now are dimm'd with death 's black veil have been as piercing as the mid day sun to search the secret treasons of the world the wrinkles in my brows now filled with blood were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres for who lived king but i could dig his grave and who durst mine when warwick bent his brow lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood my parks my walks my manors that i had even now forsake me and of all my lands is nothing left me but my body 's length why what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust and live we how we can yet die we must enter oxford and somerset ah warwick warwick wert thou as we are we might recover all our

thy lips keep in my soul awhile thou lovest me not for brother if thou didst thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood that glues my lips and will not let me speak come quickly montague or i am dead ah warwick montague hath breathed his last and to the latest gasp cried out for warwick and said commend me to my valiant brother and more he would have said and more he spoke which sounded like a clamour in a vault that mought not be distinguished but at last i well might hear delivered with a groan o farewell warwick sweet rest his soul fly lords and save yourselves for warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven dies away away to meet the queen 's great power here they bear away his body exeunt scene iii another part of the field flourish enter king edward iv in triumph with gloucester clarence and the rest thus far our fortune keeps an upward course and we are graced with wreaths of victory but in the midst of this bright shining day i spy a black suspicious threatening cloud that will encounter with our glorious sun ere he attain his easeful western bed i mean my lords those powers that the queen hath raised in gallia have arrived our coast and as we hear march on to fight with us a little gale will soon disperse that cloud and blow it to the source from whence it came the very beams will dry those vapours up for every cloud engenders not a storm the queen is valued thirty thousand strong and somerset with oxford fled to her if she have time to breathe be well assured her faction will be full as strong as ours we are advertised by our loving friends that

along strike up the drum cry courage and away exeunt scene iv plains near tewksbury march enter queen margaret prince edward somerset oxford and soldiers great lords wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss but cheerly seek how to redress their harms what though the mast be now blown overboard the cable broke the holding anchor lost and half our sailors swallow'd in the flood yet lives our pilot still is't meet that he should leave the helm and like a fearful lad with tearful eyes add water to the sea and give more strength to that which hath too much whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock which industry and courage might have saved ah what a shame ah what a fault were this say warwick was our anchor what of that and montague our topmost what of him our slaughter'd friends the tackles what of these why is not oxford here another anchor and somerset another goodly mast the friends of france our shrouds and tacklings and though unskilful why not ned and i for once allow'd the skilful pilot 's charge we will not from the helm to sit and weep but keep our course though the rough wind say no from shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck as good to chide the waves as speak them fair and what is edward but ruthless sea what clarence but a quicksand of deceit and richard but a ragged fatal rock all these the enemies to our poor bark say you can swim alas tis but a while tread on the sand why there you quickly sink bestride the rock the tide will wash you off or else you famish that 's a threefold death this speak i lords to let you understand if case some one of you would fly from us that there 's no hoped for mercy with the brothers more than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks why courage then what can not be avoided twere childish weakness to lament or fear methinks a woman of this valiant spirit should if a coward heard her speak these words infuse his breast with magnanimity and make him naked foil a man at arms i speak not this as doubting any here for did i but suspect a fearful man he should have leave to go away betimes lest in our need he might infect another and make him of like spirit to himself if any such be here as god forbid!-- let him depart before we need his help women and children of so high a courage and warriors faint why twere perpetual shame o brave young prince thy famous grandfather doth live again in thee long mayst thou live to bear his image and renew his glories and he that will not fight for such a hope go home to bed and like the owl by day if he arise be mock'd and wonder'd at thanks gentle somerset sweet oxford thanks and take his thanks that yet hath nothing else enter a messenger prepare you lords for edward is at hand ready to fight therefore be resolute i thought no less it is his

the galleys have sent a dozen sequent messengers this very night at one another 's heels and many of the consuls raised and met are at the duke 's already you have been hotly call'd for when being not

with your weapons o thou foul thief where hast thou stow'd my daughter damn'd as thou art thou hast enchanted her for i 'll refer me to all things of sense if she in chains of magic were not bound whether a maid so tender fair and happy so opposite to marriage that she shunned the wealthy curled darlings of our nation would ever have to incur a general mock run from her guardage to the sooty bosom of such a thing as thou to fear not to delight judge me the world if tis not gross in sense that thou hast practised on her with foul charms abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals that weaken motion i 'll have't disputed on tis probable and palpable to thinking i therefore apprehend and do attach thee for an abuser of the world a practiser of arts inhibited and out of warrant lay hold upon him if he do resist subdue him at his peril hold your hands both you of my inclining and the rest were it my cue to fight i should have known it without a prompter where will you that i go to answer this your charge to prison till fit time of law and course of direct session call thee to answer what if i do obey how may the duke be therewith satisfied whose messengers are here about my side upon some present business of the state to bring me to him tis true most worthy signior the duke 's in council and your noble self i am sure is sent for how the duke in council in this time of the night bring him away mine 's not an idle cause the duke himself or any of my brothers of the state can not but feel this wrong as twere their own for if such actions may have passage free bond slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be exeunt scene iii a council chamber the duke and senators sitting at a table officers attending there is no composition in these news that gives them credit indeed they are disproportion'd my letters say a hundred and seven galleys and mine a hundred and forty and mine two hundred but though they jump not on a just account,-- as in these cases where the aim reports tis oft with difference yet do they all confirm a turkish fleet and bearing up to cyprus nay it is possible enough to judgment i do not so secure me in the error but the main article i do approve in fearful sense within   what ho what ho what ho a messenger from the galleys enter a sailor now what 's the business the turkish preparation makes for rhodes so was i bid report here to the state by signior angelo how say you by this change this can not be by no assay of reason tis a pageant to keep us in false gaze when we consider the importancy of cyprus to the turk and let ourselves again but understand that as it more concerns the turk than rhodes so may he with more facile question bear it for that it stands not in such warlike brace but altogether lacks the abilities that rhodes is dress'd in if we make thought of this we must not think the turk is so unskilful to leave that latest which concerns him first neglecting an attempt of ease and gain to wake and wage a danger profitless nay in all confidence he 's not for rhodes here is more news enter a messenger the ottomites reverend and gracious steering with due course towards the isle of rhodes have there injointed them with an after fleet ay so i thought how many as you guess of thirty sail and now they do restem their backward course bearing with frank appearance their purposes toward cyprus signior montano your trusty and most valiant servitor with his free duty recommends you thus and prays you to believe him tis certain then for cyprus marcus luccicos is not he in town he 's now in florence write from us to him post post haste dispatch here comes brabantio and the valiant moor enter brabantio othello iago roderigo and officers valiant othello we must straight employ you against the general enemy ottoman to brabantio i did not see you welcome gentle signior we lack'd your counsel and your help tonight so did i yours good your grace pardon me neither my place nor aught i heard of business hath raised me from my bed nor doth the general care take hold on me for my particular grief is of so flood gate and o'erbearing nature that it engluts and swallows other sorrows and it is still itself why what 's the matter my daughter o my daughter dead ay to me she is abused stol'n from me and corrupted by spells and medicines bought of mountebanks for nature so preposterously to err being not deficient blind or lame of sense sans witchcraft could not whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself and you of her the bloody book of law you shall yourself read in the bitter letter after your own sense yea though our proper son stood in your action humbly i thank your grace here is the man this moor whom now it seems your special mandate for the state affairs hath hither brought we are very sorry for't to othello   what in your own part can you say to this nothing but this is so most potent grave and reverend signiors my very noble and approved good masters that i have ta'en away this old man 's daughter it is most true true i have married her the very head and front of my offending hath this extent no more rude am i in my speech and little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace for since these arms of mine had seven years pith till now some nine moons wasted they have used their dearest action in the tented field and little of this great world can i speak more than pertains to feats of broil and battle and therefore little shall i grace my cause in speaking for myself yet by your gracious patience i will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver of my whole course of love what drugs what charms what conjuration and what mighty magic for such proceeding i am charged withal i won his daughter a maiden never bold of spirit so still and quiet that her motion blush'd at herself and she in spite of nature of years of country credit every thing to fall in love with what she fear'd to look on it is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect that will confess perfection so could err against all rules of nature and must be driven to find out practises of cunning hell why this should be i therefore vouch again that with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood or with some dram conjured to this effect he wrought upon her to vouch this is no proof without more wider and more overt test than these thin habits and poor likelihoods of modern seeming do prefer against him but othello speak did you by indirect and forced courses subdue and poison this young maid 's affections or came it by request and such fair question as soul to soul affordeth i do beseech you send for the lady to the sagittary and let her speak of me before her father if you do find me foul in her report the trust the office i do hold of you not only take away but let your sentence even fall upon my life fetch desdemona hither ancient conduct them you best know the place exeunt iago and attendants and till she come as truly as to heaven i do confess the vices of my blood so justly to your grave ears i 'll present how i did thrive in this fair lady 's love and she in mine say it othello her father loved me oft invited me still question'd me the story of my life from year to year the battles sieges fortunes that i have passed i ran it through even from my boyish days to the very moment that he bade me tell it wherein i spake of most disastrous chances of moving accidents by flood and field of hair breadth scapes i the imminent deadly breach of being taken by the insolent foe and sold to slavery of my redemption thence and portance in my travels history wherein of antres vast and deserts idle rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven it was my hint to speak,--such was the process and of the cannibals that each other eat the anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders this to hear would desdemona seriously incline but still the house affairs would draw her thence which ever as she could with haste dispatch she'ld come again and with a greedy ear devour up my discourse which i observing took once a pliant hour and found good means to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart that i would all my pilgrimage dilate whereof by parcels she had something heard but not intentively i did consent and often did beguile her of her tears when i did speak of some distressful stroke that my youth suffer'd my story being done she gave me for my pains a world of sighs she swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange twas pitiful twas wondrous pitiful she wish'd she had not heard it yet she wish'd that heaven had made her such a man she thank'd me and bade me if i had a friend that loved her i should but teach him how to tell my story and that would woo her upon this hint i spake she loved me for the dangers i had pass'd and i loved her that she did pity them this only is the witchcraft i have used here comes the lady let her witness it enter desdemona iago and attendants i think this tale would win my daughter too good brabantio take up this mangled matter at the best men do their broken weapons rather use than their bare hands i pray you hear her speak if she confess that she was half the wooer destruction on my head if my bad blame light on the man come hither gentle mistress do you perceive in all this noble company where most you owe obedience my noble father i do perceive here a divided duty to you i am bound for life and education my life and education both do learn me how to respect you you are the lord of duty i am hitherto your daughter but here 's my husband and so much duty as my mother show'd to you preferring you before her father so much i challenge that i may profess due to the moor my lord god be wi you i have done please it your grace on to the state affairs i had rather to adopt a child than get it come hither moor i here do give thee that with all my heart which but thou hast already with all my heart i would keep from thee for your sake jewel i am glad at soul i have no other child for thy escape would teach me tyranny to hang clogs on them i have done my lord let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence which as a grise or step may help these lovers into your favour when remedies are past the griefs are ended by seeing the worst which late on hopes depended to mourn a mischief that is past and gone is the next way to draw new mischief on what can not be preserved when fortune takes patience her injury a mockery makes the robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief he robs himself that spends a bootless grief so let the turk of cyprus us beguile we lose it not so long as we can smile he bears the sentence well that nothing bears but the free comfort which from thence he hears but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow that to pay grief must of poor patience borrow these sentences to sugar or to gall being strong on both sides are equivocal but words are words i never yet did hear that the bruised heart was pierced through the ear i humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state the turk with a most mighty preparation makes for cyprus othello the fortitude of the place is best known to you and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer voice on you you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition the tyrant custom most grave senators hath made the flinty and steel couch of war my thrice driven bed of down i do agnise a natural and prompt alacrity i find in hardness and do undertake these present wars against the ottomites most humbly therefore bending to your state i crave fit disposition for my wife due reference of place and exhibition with such accommodation and besort as levels with her breeding if you please be't at her father 's i 'll not have it so nor i. nor i i would not there reside to put my father in impatient thoughts by being in his eye most gracious duke to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear and let me find a charter in your voice to assist my simpleness what would you desdemona that i did love the moor to live with him my downright violence and storm of fortunes may trumpet to the world my heart 's subdued even to the very quality of my lord i saw othello 's visage in his mind and to his honour and his valiant parts did i my soul and fortunes consecrate so that dear lords if i be left behind a moth of peace and he go to the war the rites for which i love him are bereft me and i a heavy interim shall support by his dear absence let me go with him let her have your voices vouch with me heaven i therefore beg it not to please the palate of my appetite nor to comply with heat the young affects in me defunct and proper satisfaction but to be free and bounteous to her mind and heaven defend your good souls that you think i will your serious and great business scant for she is with me no when light wing'd toys of feather'd cupid seal with wanton dullness my speculative and officed instruments that my disports corrupt and taint my business let housewives make a skillet of my helm and all indign and base adversities make head against my estimation be it as you shall privately determine either for her stay or going the affair cries haste and speed must answer it you must away to night with all my heart at nine i the morning here we 'll meet again othello leave some officer behind and he shall our commission bring to you with such things else of quality and respect as doth import you so please your grace my ancient a man he is of honest and trust to his conveyance i assign my wife with what else needful your good grace shall think to be sent after me let it be so good night to every one to brabantio and noble signior if virtue no delighted beauty lack your son in law is far more fair than black adieu brave moor use desdemona well look to her moor if thou hast eyes to see she has deceived her father and may thee exeunt duke of venice senators officers   and c my life upon her faith honest iago my desdemona must i leave to thee i prithee let thy wife attend on her and bring them after in the best advantage come desdemona i have but an hour of love of worldly matters and direction to spend with thee we must obey the time exeunt othello and desdemona iago,-- what say'st thou noble heart what will i do thinkest thou why go to bed and sleep i will incontinently drown myself if thou dost i shall never love thee after why thou silly gentleman it is silliness to live when to live is torment and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician o villainous i have looked upon the world for four times seven years and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man that knew how to love himself ere i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen i would change my humanity with a baboon what should i do i confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it virtue a fig tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus our bodies are our gardens to the which our wills are gardeners so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions but we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings our unbitted lusts whereof i take this that you call love to be a sect or scion it can not be it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will come be a man drown thyself drown cats and blind puppies i have professed me thy friend and i confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness i could never better stead thee than now put money in thy purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favour with an usurped beard i say put money in thy purse it can not be that desdemona should long continue her love to the moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he his to her it was a violent commencement and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but money in thy purse these moors are changeable in their wills fill thy purse with money:--the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida she must change for youth when she is sated with his body she will find the error of her choice she must have change she must therefore put money in thy purse if thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning make all the money thou canst if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle venetian not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money a pox of drowning thyself it is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her wilt thou be fast to my hopes if i depend on the issue thou art sure of me:--go make money:--i have told thee often and i re tell thee again and again i hate the moor my cause is hearted thine hath no less reason let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport there are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered traverse go provide thy money we will have more of this to morrow adieu where shall we meet i the morning at my lodging i 'll be with thee betimes go to farewell do you hear roderigo what say you no more of drowning do you hear i am changed i 'll go sell all my land exit thus do i ever make my fool my purse for i mine own gain'd knowledge should profane if i would time expend with such a snipe but for my sport and profit i hate the moor and it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets he has done my office i know not if't be true but i for mere suspicion in that kind will do as if for surety he holds me well the better shall my purpose work on him cassio 's a proper man let me see now to get his place and to plume up my will in double knavery how how let 's see:-- after some time to abuse othello 's ear that he is too familiar with his wife he hath a person and a smooth dispose to be suspected framed to make women false the moor is of a free and open nature that thinks men honest that but seem to be so and will as tenderly be led by the nose as asses are i have't it is engender'd hell and night must bring this monstrous birth to the world 's light exit act ii scene i. a sea port in cyprus an open place near the quay enter montano and two gentlemen what from the cape can you discern at sea nothing at all it is a highwrought flood i can not twixt the heaven and the main descry a sail methinks

of this a segregation of the turkish fleet for do but stand upon the foaming shore the chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds the wind shaked surge with high and monstrous mane seems to cast water on

they were parted with foul and violent tempest pray heavens he be for i have served him and the man commands like a full soldier let 's to the seaside ho as well to see the vessel that 's come in as to throw out our eyes for brave othello even till we make the main and the aerial blue an indistinct regard come let 's do so for every minute is expectancy of more arrivance enter cassio thanks you the valiant of this warlike isle that so approve the moor o let the heavens give him defence against the elements for i have lost us him on a dangerous sea is he well shipp'd his bark is stoutly timber'd his pilot of very expert and approved allowance therefore my hopes not surfeited to death stand in bold cure a cry within a sail a sail a sail enter a fourth gentleman what noise the town is empty on the brow o the sea stand ranks of people and they cry a sail my hopes do shape him for the governor guns heard they do discharge their shot of courtesy our friends at least i pray you sir go forth and give us truth who tis that is arrived i shall exit but good lieutenant is your general wived most fortunately he hath achieved a maid that paragons description and wild fame one that excels the quirks of blazoning pens and in the essential vesture of creation does tire the ingener re enter second gentleman how now who has put in tis one iago ancient to the general has had most favourable and happy speed tempests themselves high seas and howling winds the gutter'd rocks and congregated sands-- traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,-- as having sense of beauty do omit their mortal natures letting go safely by the divine desdemona what is she she that i spake of our great captain 's captain left in the conduct of the bold iago whose footing here anticipates our thoughts a se'nnight 's speed great jove othello guard and swell his sail with thine own powerful breath that he may bless this bay with his tall ship make love 's quick pants in desdemona 's arms give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits and bring all cyprus comfort enter desdemona emilia iago roderigo and attendants o behold the riches of the ship is come on shore ye men of cyprus let her have your knees hail to thee lady and the grace of heaven before behind thee and on every hand enwheel thee round i thank you valiant cassio what tidings can you tell me of my lord he is not yet arrived nor know i aught but that he 's well and will be shortly here o but i fear how lost you company the great contention of the sea and skies parted our fellowship but hark a sail within a sail a sail guns heard they give their greeting to the citadel this likewise is a friend see for the news exit gentleman good ancient you are welcome to emilia welcome mistress let it not gall your patience good iago that i extend my manners tis my breeding that gives me this bold show of courtesy kissing her sir would she give you so much of her lips as of her tongue she oft bestows on me you 'll have enough alas she has no speech in faith too much i find it still when i have list to sleep marry before your ladyship i grant she puts her tongue a little in her heart and chides with thinking you have little cause to say so come on come on you are pictures out of doors bells in your parlors wild cats in your kitchens saints m your injuries devils being offended players in your housewifery and housewives in your beds o fie upon thee slanderer nay it is true or else i am a turk you rise to play and go to bed to work you shall not write my praise no let me not what wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldst praise me o gentle lady do not put me to't for i am nothing if not critical come on assay there 's one gone to the harbour ay madam i am not merry but i do beguile the thing i am by seeming otherwise come how wouldst thou praise me i am about it but indeed my invention comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize it plucks out brains and all but my muse labours and thus she is deliver'd if she be fair and wise fairness and wit the one 's for use the other useth it well praised how if she be black and witty if she be black and thereto have a wit she 'll find a white that shall her blackness fit worse and worse how if fair and foolish she never yet was foolish that was fair for even her folly help'd her to an heir these are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i the alehouse what miserable praise hast thou for her that 's foul and foolish there 's none so foul and foolish thereunto but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do o heavy ignorance thou praisest the worst best but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself she that was ever fair and never proud had tongue at will and yet was never loud never lack'd gold and yet went never gay fled from her wish and yet said now i may she that being anger'd her revenge being nigh bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly she that in wisdom never was so frail to change the cod 's head for the salmon 's tail she that could think and ne'er disclose her mind see suitors following and not look behind she was a wight if ever such wight were,-- to do what to suckle fools and chronicle small beer o most lame and impotent conclusion do not learn of him emilia though he be thy husband how say you cassio is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor he speaks home madam you may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar aside   he takes her by the palm ay well said whisper with as little a web as this will i ensnare as great a fly as cassio ay smile upon her do i will gyve thee in thine own courtship you say true tis so indeed if such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in very good well kissed an excellent courtesy tis so indeed yet again your fingers to your lips would they were clyster pipes for your sake trumpet within the moor i know his trumpet tis truly so let 's meet him and receive him lo where he comes enter othello and attendants o my fair warrior my dear othello it gives me wonder great as my content to see you here before me o my soul 's joy if after every tempest come such calms may the winds blow till they have waken'd death and let the labouring bark climb hills of seas olympus high and duck again as low as hell 's from heaven if it were now to die twere now to be most happy for i fear my soul hath her content so absolute that not another comfort like to this succeeds in unknown fate the heavens forbid but that our loves and comforts should increase even as our days do grow amen to that sweet powers i can not speak enough of this content it stops me here it is too much of joy and this and this the greatest discords be kissing her that e'er our hearts shall make aside   o you are well tuned now but i 'll set down the pegs that make this music as honest as i am come let us to the castle news friends our wars are done the turks are drown'd how does my old acquaintance of this isle honey you shall be well desired in cyprus i have found great love amongst them o my sweet i prattle out of fashion and i dote in mine own comforts i prithee good iago go to the bay and disembark my coffers bring thou the master to the citadel he is a good one and his worthiness does challenge much respect come desdemona once more well met at cyprus exeunt othello desdemona and attendants do thou meet me presently at the harbour come hither if thou be'st valiant,-- as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them list me the lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard:--first i must tell thee this desdemona is directly in love with him with him why tis not possible lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed mark me with what violence she first loved the moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies and will she love him still for prating let not thy discreet heart think it her eye must be fed and what delight shall she have to look on the devil when the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the moor is defective in now for want of these required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice now sir this granted,--as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio does a knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection why none why none a slipper and subtle knave a finder of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after a pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already i can not believe that in her she 's full of most blessed condition blessed fig's end the wine she drinks is made of grapes if she had been blessed she would never have loved the moor blessed pudding didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand didst not mark that yes that i did but that was but courtesy lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts they met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together villanous thoughts roderigo when these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise the incorporate conclusion pish but sir be you ruled by me i have brought you from venice watch you to night for the command i 'll lay't upon you cassio knows you not i 'll not be far from you do you find some occasion to anger cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favourably minister well sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply may strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that will i cause these of cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of cassio so shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means i shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity i will do this if i can bring it to any opportunity i warrant thee meet me by and by at the citadel i must fetch his necessaries ashore farewell adieu exit that cassio loves her i do well believe it that she loves him tis apt and of great credit the moor howbeit that i endure him not is of a constant loving noble nature and i dare think he 'll prove to desdemona a most dear husband now i do love her too not out of absolute lust though peradventure i stand accountant for as great a sin but partly led to diet my revenge for that i do suspect the lusty moor hath leap'd into my seat the thought whereof doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards and nothing can or shall content my soul till i am even'd with him wife for wife or failing so yet that i put the moor at least into a jealousy so strong that judgment can not cure which thing to do if this poor trash of venice whom i trash for his quick hunting stand the putting on i 'll have our michael cassio on the hip abuse him to the moor in the rank garb-- for i fear cassio with my night cap too-- make the moor thank me love me and reward me for making him egregiously an ass and practising upon his peace and quiet even to madness tis here but yet confused knavery 's plain face is never seen tin used exit scene ii a street enter a herald with a proclamation people following it is othello 's pleasure our noble and valiant general that upon certain tidings now arrived importing the mere perdition of the turkish fleet every man put himself into triumph some to dance some to make bonfires each man to what sport and revels his addiction leads him for besides these beneficial news it is the celebration of his nuptial so much was his pleasure should be proclaimed all offices are open and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven heaven bless the isle of cyprus and our noble general othello exeunt scene iii a hall in the castle enter othello desdemona cassio and attendants good michael look you to the guard to night let 's teach ourselves that honourable stop not to outsport discretion iago hath direction what to do but notwithstanding with my personal eye will i look to't iago is most honest michael good night to morrow with your earliest let me have speech with you to desdemona come my dear love the purchase made the fruits are to ensue that profit 's yet to come tween me and you good night exeunt othello desdemona and attendants enter iago welcome iago we must to the watch not this hour lieutenant tis not yet ten o the clock our general cast us thus early for the love of his desdemona who let us not therefore blame he hath not yet made wanton the night with her and she is sport for jove she 's a most exquisite lady and i 'll warrant her fun of game indeed she 's a most fresh and delicate creature what an eye she has methinks it sounds a parley of provocation an inviting eye and yet methinks right modest and when she speaks is it not an alarum to love she is indeed perfection well happiness to their sheets come lieutenant i have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace of cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black othello not to night good iago i have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking i could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment o they are our friends but one cup i 'll drink for you i have drunk but one cup to night and that was craftily qualified too and behold what innovation it makes here i am unfortunate in the infirmity and dare not task my weakness with any more what man tis a night of revels the gallants desire it where are they here at the door i pray you call them in i 'll do't but it dislikes me exit if i can fasten but one cup upon him with that which he hath drunk to night already he 'll be as full of quarrel and offence as my young mistress dog now my sick fool roderigo whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out to desdemona hath to night caroused potations pottle deep and he 's to watch three lads of cyprus noble swelling spirits that hold their honours in a wary distance the very elements of this warlike isle have i to night fluster'd with flowing cups and they watch too now mongst this flock of drunkards am i to put our cassio in some action that may offend the isle.--but here they come if consequence do but approve my dream my boat sails freely both with wind and stream re enter cassio with him montano and gentlemen servants following with wine fore god they have given me a rouse already good faith a little one not past a pint as i am a soldier some wine ho sings and let me the canakin clink clink and let me the canakin clink a soldier 's a man a life 's but a span why then let a soldier drink some wine boys fore god an excellent song i learned it in england where indeed they are most potent in potting your dane your german and your swag bellied hollander drink ho!--are nothing to your english is your englishman so expert in his drinking why he drinks you with facility your dane dead drunk he sweats not to overthrow your almain he gives your hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled to the health of our general i am for it lieutenant and i 'll do you justice o sweet england king stephen was a worthy peer his breeches cost him but a crown he held them sixpence all too dear with that he call'd the tailor lown he was a wight of high renown and thou art but of low degree tis pride that pulls the country down then take thine auld cloak about thee some wine ho why this is a more exquisite song than the other will you hear't again no for i hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things well god 's above all and there be souls must be saved and there be souls must not be saved it 's true good lieutenant for mine own part,--no offence to the general nor any man of quality,--i hope to be saved and so do i too lieutenant ay but by your leave not before me the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient let 's have no more of this let 's to our affairs.--forgive us our sins!--gentlemen let 's look to our business do not think gentlemen i am drunk this is my ancient this is my right hand and this is my left i am not drunk now i can stand well enough and speak well enough excellent well why very well then you must not think then that i am drunk exit to the platform masters come let 's set the watch you see this fellow that is gone before he is a soldier fit to stand by caesar and give direction and do but see his vice tis to his virtue a just equinox the one as long as the other tis pity of him i fear the trust othello puts him in on some odd time of his infirmity will shake this island but is he often thus tis evermore the prologue to his sleep he 'll watch the horologe a double set if drink rock not his cradle it were well the general were put in mind of it perhaps he sees it not or his good nature prizes the virtue that appears in cassio and looks not on his evils is not this true enter roderigo aside to him   how now roderigo i pray you after the lieutenant go exit roderigo and tis great pity that the noble moor should hazard such a place as his own second with one of an ingraft infirmity it were an honest action to say so to the moor not i for this fair island i do love cassio well and would do much to cure him of this evil but hark what noise cry within help help re enter cassio driving in roderigo you rogue you rascal what 's the matter lieutenant a knave teach me my duty i 'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle beat me dost thou prate rogue striking roderigo nay good lieutenant staying him i pray you sir hold your hand let me go sir or i 'll knock you o'er the mazzard come come you 're drunk drunk they fight aside to roderigo   away i say go out and cry a mutiny exit roderigo nay good lieutenant,--alas gentlemen;-- help ho!--lieutenant,--sir,--montano,--sir help masters!--here 's a goodly watch indeed bell rings who 's that which rings the bell?--diablo ho the town will rise god 's will lieutenant hold you will be shamed for ever re enter othello and attendants what is the matter here zounds i bleed still i am hurt to the death faints hold for your lives hold ho lieutenant,--sir montano,--gentlemen,-- have you forgot all sense of place and duty hold the general speaks to you hold hold for shame why how now ho from whence ariseth this are we turn'd turks and to ourselves do that which heaven hath forbid the ottomites for christian shame put by this barbarous brawl he that stirs next to carve for his own rage holds his soul light he dies upon his motion silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle from her propriety what is the matter masters honest iago that look'st dead with grieving speak who began this on thy love i charge thee i do not know friends all but now even now in quarter and in terms like bride and groom devesting them for bed and then but now-- as if some planet had unwitted men-- swords out and tilting one at other 's breast in opposition bloody i can not speak any beginning to this peevish odds and would in action glorious i had lost those legs that brought me to a part of it how comes it michael you are thus forgot i pray you pardon me i can not speak worthy montano you were wo nt be civil the gravity and stillness of your youth the world hath noted and your name is great in mouths of wisest censure what 's the matter that you unlace your reputation thus and spend your rich opinion for the name of a night brawler give me answer to it worthy othello i am hurt to danger your officer iago can inform you,-- while i spare speech which something now offends me,-- of all that i do know nor know i aught by me that 's said or done amiss this night unless self charity be sometimes a vice and to defend ourselves it be a sin when violence assails us now by heaven my blood begins my safer guides to rule and passion having my best judgment collied assays to lead the way if i once stir or do but lift this arm the best of you shall sink in my rebuke give me to know how this foul rout began who set it on and he that is approved in this offence though he had twinn'd with me both at a birth shall lose me what in a town of war yet wild the people 's hearts brimful of fear to manage private and domestic quarrel in night and on the court and guard of safety tis monstrous iago who began't if partially affined or leagued in office thou dost deliver more or less than truth thou art no soldier touch me not so near i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offence to michael cassio yet i persuade myself to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him thus it is general montano and myself being in speech there comes a fellow crying out for help and cassio following him with determined sword to execute upon him sir this gentleman steps in to cassio and entreats his pause myself the crying fellow did pursue lest by his clamour as it so fell out-- the town might fall in fright he swift of foot outran my purpose and i return'd the rather for that i heard the clink and fall of swords and cassio high in oath which till to night i ne'er might say before when i came back-- for this was brief i found them close together at blow and thrust even as again they were when you yourself did part them more of this matter can not i report but men are men the best sometimes forget though cassio did some little wrong to him as men in rage strike those that wish them best yet surely cassio i believe received from him that fled some strange indignity which patience could not pass i know iago thy honesty and love doth mince this matter making it light to cassio cassio i love thee but never more be officer of mine re enter desdemona attended look if my gentle love be not raised up i 'll make thee an example what 's the matter all 's well now sweeting come away to bed sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon lead him off to montano who is led off iago look with care about the town and silence those whom this vile brawl distracted come desdemona tis the soldiers life to have their balmy slumbers waked with strife exeunt all but iago and cassio what are you hurt lieutenant ay past all surgery marry heaven forbid reputation reputation reputation o i have lost my reputation i have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial my reputation iago my reputation as i am an honest man i thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser what man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and he 's yours i will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear and discourse fustian with one 's own shadow o thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil what was he that you followed with your sword what had he done to you i know not is't possible i remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore o god that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains that we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts why but you are now well enough how came you thus recovered it hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath one unperfectness shows me another to make me frankly despise myself come you are too severe a moraler as the time the place and the condition of this country stands i could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good i will ask him for my place again he shall tell me i am a drunkard had i as many mouths as hydra such an answer would stop them all to be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast o strange every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used exclaim no more against it and good lieutenant i think you think i love you i have well approved it sir i drunk you or any man living may be drunk at a time man i 'll tell you what you shall do our general 's wife is now the general may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces confess yourself freely to her importune her help to put you in your place again she is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before you advise me well i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness i think it freely and betimes in the morning i will beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me i am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here you are in the right good night lieutenant i must to the watch cassio good night honest iago exit and what 's he then that says i play the villain when this advice is free i give and honest probal to thinking and indeed the course to win the moor again for tis most easy the inclining desdemona to subdue in any honest suit she 's framed as fruitful as the free elements and then for her to win the moor were't to renounce his baptism all seals and symbols of redeemed sin his soul is so enfetter'd to her love that she may make unmake do what she list even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function how am i then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course directly to his good divinity of hell when devils will the blackest sins put on they do suggest at first with heavenly shows as i do now for whiles this honest fool plies desdemona to repair his fortunes and she for him pleads strongly to the moor i 'll pour this pestilence into his ear that she repeals him for her body 's lust and by how much she strives to do him good she shall undo her credit with the moor so will i turn her virtue into pitch and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all re enter roderigo how now roderigo i do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry my money is almost spent i have been to night exceedingly well cudgelled and i think the issue will be i shall have so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to venice how poor are they that have not patience what wound did ever heal but by degrees thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft and wit depends on dilatory time does't not go well cassio hath beaten thee and thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd cassio though other things grow fair against the sun yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe content thyself awhile by the mass tis morning pleasure and action make the hours seem short retire thee go where thou art billeted away i say thou shalt know more hereafter nay get thee gone exit roderigo two things are to be done my wife must move for cassio to her mistress i 'll set her on myself the while to draw the moor apart and bring him jump when he may cassio find soliciting his wife ay that 's the way dull not device by coldness and delay exit act iii scene i. before the castle enter cassio and some musicians masters play here i will content your pains something that 's brief and bid good morrow general music enter clown why masters have your instruments been in naples that they speak i the nose thus how sir how are these i pray you wind instruments ay marry are they sir o thereby hangs a tail whereby hangs a tale sir marry sir by many a wind instrument that i know but masters here 's money for you and the general so likes your music that he desires you for love 's sake to make no more noise with it well sir we will not if you have any music that may not be heard to't again but as they say to hear music the general does not greatly care we have none such sir then put up your pipes in your bag for i 'll away go vanish into air away exeunt musicians dost thou hear my honest friend no i hear not your honest friend i hear you prithee keep up thy quillets there 's a poor piece of gold for thee if the gentlewoman that attends the general 's wife be stirring tell her there 's one cassio entreats her a little favour of speech wilt thou do this she is stirring sir if she will stir hither i shall seem to notify unto her do good my friend exit clown enter iago in happy time iago you have not been a bed then why no the day had broke before we parted i have made bold iago to send in to your wife my suit to her is that she will to virtuous desdemona procure me some access i 'll send her to you presently and i 'll devise a mean to draw the moor out of the way that your converse and business may be more free i humbly thank you for't exit iago i never knew a florentine more kind and honest enter emilia good morrow good lieutenant i am sorry for your displeasure but all will sure be well the general and his wife are talking of it and she speaks for you stoutly the moor replies that he you hurt is of great fame in cyprus and great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom he might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you and needs no other suitor but his likings to take the safest occasion by the front to bring you in again yet i beseech you if you think fit or that it may be done give me advantage of some brief discourse with desdemona alone pray you come in i will bestow you where you shall have time to speak your bosom freely i am much bound to you exeunt scene ii a room in the castle enter othello iago and gentlemen these letters give iago to the pilot and by him do my duties to the senate that done i will be walking on the works repair there to me well my good lord i 'll do't this fortification gentlemen shall we see't we 'll wait upon your lordship exeunt scene iii the garden of the castle enter desdemona cassio and emilia be thou assured good cassio i will do all my abilities in thy behalf good madam do i warrant it grieves my husband as if the case were his o that 's an honest fellow do not doubt cassio but i will have my lord and you again as friendly as you were bounteous madam whatever shall become of michael cassio he 's never any thing but your true servant i know't i thank you you do love my lord you have known him long and be you well assured he shall in strangeness stand no further off than in a polite distance ay but lady that policy may either last so long or feed upon such nice and waterish diet or breed itself so out of circumstance that i being absent and my place supplied my general will forget my love and service do not doubt that before emilia here i give thee warrant of thy place assure thee if i do vow a friendship i 'll perform it to the last article my lord shall never rest i 'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience his bed shall seem a school his board a shrift i 'll intermingle every thing he does with cassio 's suit therefore be merry cassio for thy solicitor shall rather die than give thy cause away madam here comes my lord madam i 'll take my leave why stay and hear me speak madam not now i am very ill at ease unfit for mine own purposes well do your discretion exit cassio enter othello and iago ha i like not that what dost thou say nothing my lord or if i know not what was not that cassio parted from my wife cassio my lord no sure i can not think it that he would steal away so guilty like seeing you coming i do believe twas he how now my lord i have been talking with a suitor here a man that languishes in your displeasure who is't you mean why your lieutenant cassio good my lord if i have any grace or power to move you his present reconciliation take for if he be not one that truly loves you that errs in ignorance and not in cunning i have no judgment in an honest face i prithee call him back went he hence now ay sooth so humbled that he hath left part of his grief with me to suffer with him good love call him back not now sweet desdemona some other time but shall't be shortly the sooner sweet for you shall't be to night at supper no not to night to morrow dinner then i shall not dine at home i meet the captains at the citadel why then to morrow night or tuesday morn on tuesday noon or night on wednesday morn i prithee name the time but let it not exceed three days in faith he 's penitent and yet his trespass in our common reason-- save that they say the wars must make examples out of their best is not almost a fault to incur a private cheque when shall he come tell me othello i wonder in my soul what you would ask me that i should deny or stand so mammering on what michael cassio that came a wooing with you and so many a time when i have spoke of you dispraisingly hath ta'en your part to have so much to do to bring him in trust me i could do much,-- prithee no more let him come when he will i will deny thee nothing why this is not a boon tis as i should entreat you wear your gloves or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm or sue to you to do a peculiar profit to your own person nay when i have a suit wherein i mean to touch your love indeed it shall be full of poise and difficult weight and fearful to be granted i will deny thee nothing whereon i do beseech thee grant me this to leave me but a little to myself shall i deny you no farewell my lord farewell my desdemona i 'll come to thee straight emilia come be as your fancies teach you whate'er you be i am obedient exeunt desdemona and emilia excellent wretch perdition catch my soul but i do love thee and when i love thee not chaos is come again my noble lord-- what dost thou say iago did michael cassio when you woo'd my lady know of your love he did from first to last why dost thou ask but for a satisfaction of my thought no further harm why of thy thought iago i did not think he had been acquainted with her o yes and went between us very oft indeed indeed ay indeed discern'st thou aught in that is he not honest honest my lord honest ay honest my lord for aught i know what dost thou think think my lord think my lord by heaven he echoes me as if there were some monster in his thought too hideous to be shown thou dost mean something i heard thee say even now thou likedst not that when cassio left my wife what didst not like and when i told thee he was of my counsel in my whole course of wooing thou criedst indeed and didst contract and purse thy brow together as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain some horrible conceit if thou dost love me show me thy thought my lord you know i love you i think thou dost and for i know thou'rt full of love and honesty and weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath therefore these stops of thine fright me the more for such things in a false disloyal knave are tricks of custom but in a man that 's just they are close delations working from the heart that passion can not rule for michael cassio i dare be sworn i think that he is honest i think so too men should be what they seem or those that be not would they might seem none certain men should be what they seem why then i think cassio 's an honest man nay yet there 's more in this i prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings as thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts the worst of words good my lord pardon me though i am bound to every act of duty i am not bound to that all slaves are free to utter my thoughts why say they are vile and false as where 's that palace whereinto foul things sometimes intrude not who has a breast so pure but some uncleanly apprehensions keep leets and law days and in session sit with meditations lawful thou dost conspire against thy friend iago if thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear a stranger to thy thoughts i do beseech you-- though i perchance am vicious in my guess as i confess it is my nature 's plague to spy into abuses and oft my jealousy shapes faults that are not that your wisdom yet from one that so imperfectly conceits would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble out of his scattering and unsure observance it were not for your quiet nor your good nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom to let you know my thoughts what dost thou mean good name in man and woman dear my lord is the immediate jewel of their souls who steals my purse steals trash tis something nothing twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed by heaven i 'll know thy thoughts you can not if my heart were in your hand nor shall not whilst tis in my custody ha o beware my lord of jealousy it is the green eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on that cuckold lives in bliss who certain of his fate loves not his wronger but o what damned minutes tells he o'er who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves o misery poor and content is rich and rich enough but riches fineless is as poor as winter to him that ever fears he shall be poor good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy why why is this think'st thou i'ld make a lie of jealousy to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions no to be once in doubt is once to be resolved exchange me for a goat when i shall turn the business of my soul to such exsufflicate and blown surmises matching thy inference tis not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair feeds well loves company is free of speech sings plays and dances well where virtue is these are more virtuous nor from mine own weak merits will i draw the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt for she had eyes and chose me no iago i 'll see before i doubt when i doubt prove and on the proof there is no more but this,-- away at once with love or jealousy i am glad of it for now i shall have reason to show the love and duty that i bear you with franker spirit therefore as i am bound receive it from me i speak not yet of proof look to your wife observe her well with cassio wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure i would not have your free and noble nature out of self bounty be abused look to't i know our country disposition well in venice they do let heaven see the pranks they dare not show their husbands their best conscience is not to leave't undone but keep't unknown dost thou say so she did deceive her father marrying you and when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks she loved them most and so she did why go to then she that so young could give out such a seeming to seal her father 's eyes up close as oak- he thought twas witchcraft but i am much to blame i humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you i am bound to thee for ever i see this hath a little dash'd your spirits not a jot not a jot i faith i fear it has i hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love but i do see you 're moved i am to pray you not to strain my speech to grosser issues nor to larger reach than to suspicion i will not should you do so my lord my speech should fall into such vile success as my thoughts aim not at cassio 's my worthy friend-- my lord i see you 're moved no not much moved i do not think but desdemona 's honest long live she so and long live you to think so and yet how nature erring from itself,-- ay there 's the point as to be bold with you-- not to affect many proposed matches of her own clime complexion and degree whereto we see in all things nature tends-- foh one may smell in such a will most rank foul disproportion thoughts unnatural but pardon me i do not in position distinctly speak of her though i may fear her will recoiling to her better judgment may fall to match you with her country forms and happily repent farewell farewell if more thou dost perceive let me know more set on thy wife to observe leave me iago going   my lord i take my leave why did i marry this honest creature doubtless sees and knows more much more than he unfolds returning   my lord i would i might entreat your honour to scan this thing no further leave it to time though it be fit that cassio have his place for sure he fills it up with great ability yet if you please to hold him off awhile you shall by that perceive him and his means note if your lady strain his entertainment with any strong or vehement importunity much will be seen in that in the mean time let me be thought too busy in my fears-- as worthy cause i have to fear i am-- and hold her free i do beseech your honour fear not my government i once more take my leave exit this fellow 's of exceeding honesty and knows all qualities with a learned spirit of human dealings if i do prove her haggard though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings i'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind to pray at fortune haply for i am black and have not those soft parts of conversation that chamberers have or for i am declined into the vale of years,--yet that 's not much-- she 's gone i am abused and my relief must be to loathe her o curse of marriage that we can call these delicate creatures ours and not their appetites i had rather be a toad and live upon the vapour of a dungeon than keep a corner in the thing i love for others uses yet tis the plague of great ones prerogatived are they less than the base tis destiny unshunnable like death even then this forked plague is fated to us when we do quicken desdemona comes re enter desdemona and emilia if she be false o then heaven mocks itself i 'll not believe't how now my dear othello your dinner and the generous islanders by you invited do attend your presence i am to blame why do you speak so faintly are you not well i have a pain upon my forehead here faith that 's with watching twill away again let me but bind it hard within this hour it will be well your napkin is too little he puts the handkerchief from him and it drops let it alone come i 'll go in with you i am very sorry that you are not well exeunt othello and desdemona i am glad i have found this napkin this was her first remembrance from the moor my wayward husband hath a hundred times woo'd me to steal it but she so loves the token for he conjured her she should ever keep it that she reserves it evermore about her to kiss and talk to i 'll have the work ta'en out and give't iago what he will do with it heaven knows not i i nothing but to please his fantasy re enter iago how now what do you here alone do not you chide i have a thing for you a thing for me it is a common thing-- ha to have a foolish wife o is that all what will you give me now for the same handkerchief what handkerchief what handkerchief why that the moor first gave to desdemona that which so often you did bid me steal hast stol'n it from her no faith she let it drop by negligence and to the advantage i being here took't up look here it is a good wench give it me what will you do with t that you have been so earnest to have me filch it snatching it   why what 's that to you if it be not for some purpose of import give't me again poor lady she 'll run mad when she shall lack it be not acknown on t i have use for it go leave me exit emilia i will in cassio 's lodging lose this napkin and let him find it trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ this may do something the moor already changes with my poison dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons which at the first are scarce found to distaste but with a little act upon the blood burn like the mines of sulphur i did say so look where he comes re enter othello not poppy nor mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups of the world shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep which thou owedst yesterday ha ha false to me why how now general no more of that avaunt be gone thou hast set me on the rack i swear tis better to be much abused than but to know't a little how now my lord what sense had i of her stol'n hours of lust i saw't not thought it not it harm'd not me i slept the next night well was free and merry i found not cassio 's kisses on her lips he that is robb'd not wanting what is stol'n let him not know't and he 's not robb'd at all i am sorry to hear this i had been happy if the general camp pioners and all had tasted her sweet body so i had nothing known o now for ever farewell the tranquil mind farewell content farewell the plumed troop and the big wars that make ambition virtue o farewell farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump the spirit stirring drum the ear piercing fife the royal banner and all quality pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war and o you mortal engines whose rude throats the immortal jove 's dead clamours counterfeit farewell othello 's occupation 's gone is't possible my lord villain be sure thou prove my love a whore be sure of it give me the ocular proof or by the worth of man 's eternal soul thou hadst been better have been born a dog than answer my waked wrath is't come to this make me to see't or at the least so prove it that the probation bear no hinge nor loop to hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life my noble lord,-- if thou dost slander her and torture me never pray more abandon all remorse on horror 's head horrors accumulate do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed for nothing canst thou to damnation add greater than that o grace o heaven forgive me are you a man have you a soul or sense god be wi you take mine office o wretched fool that livest to make thine honesty a vice o monstrous world take note take note o world to be direct and honest is not safe i thank you for this profit and from hence i 'll love no friend sith love breeds such offence nay stay thou shouldst be honest i should be wise for honesty 's a fool and loses that it works for by the world i think my wife be honest and think she is not i think that thou art just and think thou art not i 'll have some proof her name that was as fresh as dian 's visage is now begrimed and black as mine own face if there be cords or knives poison or fire or suffocating streams i 'll not endure it would i were satisfied i see sir you are eaten up with passion i do repent me that i put it to you you would be satisfied would nay i will and may but how how satisfied my lord would you the supervisor grossly gape on-- behold her topp'd death and damnation o it were a tedious difficulty i think to bring them to that prospect damn them then if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster more than their own what then how then what shall i say where 's satisfaction it is impossible you should see this were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys as salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross as ignorance made drunk but yet i say if imputation and strong circumstances which lead directly to the door of truth will give you satisfaction you may have't give me a living reason she 's disloyal i do not like the office but sith i am enter'd in this cause so far prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love i will go on i lay with cassio lately and being troubled with a raging tooth i could not sleep there are a kind of men so loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs one of this kind is cassio in sleep i heard him say sweet desdemona let us be wary let us hide our loves and then sir would he gripe and wring my hand cry o sweet creature and then kiss me hard as if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots that grew upon my lips then laid his leg over my thigh and sigh'd and kiss'd and then cried cursed fate that gave thee to the moor o monstrous monstrous nay this was but his dream but this denoted a foregone conclusion tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream and this may help to thicken other proofs that do demonstrate thinly i 'll tear her all to pieces nay but be wise yet we see nothing done she may be honest yet tell me but this have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wife 's hand i gave her such a one twas my first gift i know not that but such a handkerchief-- i am sure it was your wife's did i to day see cassio wipe his beard with if it be that-- if it be that or any that was hers it speaks against her with the other proofs o that the slave had forty thousand lives one is too poor too weak for my revenge now do i see tis true look here iago all my fond love thus do i blow to heaven tis gone arise black vengeance from thy hollow cell yield up o love thy crown and hearted throne to tyrannous hate swell bosom with thy fraught for tis of aspics tongues yet be content o blood blood blood patience i say your mind perhaps may change never iago like to the pontic sea whose icy current and compulsive course ne'er feels retiring ebb but keeps due on to the propontic and the hellespont even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace shall ne'er look back ne'er ebb to humble love till that a capable and wide revenge swallow them up now by yond marble heaven kneels in the due reverence of a sacred vow i here engage my words do not rise yet kneels witness you ever burning lights above you elements that clip us round about witness that here iago doth give up the execution of his wit hands heart to wrong'd othello 's service let him command and to obey shall be in me remorse what bloody business ever they rise i greet thy love not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous and will upon the instant put thee to't within these three days let me hear thee say that cassio 's not alive my friend is dead tis done at your request but let her live damn her lewd minx o damn her come go with me apart i will withdraw to furnish me with some swift means of death for the fair devil now art thou my lieutenant i am your own for ever exeunt scene iv before the castle enter desdemona emilia and clown do you know sirrah where lieutenant cassio lies i dare not say he lies any where why man he 's a soldier and for one to say a soldier lies is stabbing go to where lodges he to tell you where he lodges is to tell you where i lie can any thing be made of this i know not where he lodges and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were to lie in mine own throat can you inquire him out and be edified by report i will catechise the world for him that is make questions and by them answer seek him bid him come hither tell him i have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well to do this is within the compass of man 's wit and therefore i will attempt the doing it exit where should i lose that handkerchief emilia i know not madam believe me i had rather have lost my purse full of crusadoes and but my noble moor is true of mind and made of no such baseness as jealous creatures are it were enough to put him to ill thinking is he not jealous who he i think the sun where he was born drew all such humours from him look where he comes i will not leave him now till cassio be call'd to him enter othello how is't with you my lord well my good lady aside o hardness to dissemble!-- how do you desdemona well my good lord give me your hand this hand is moist my lady it yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow this argues fruitfulness and liberal heart hot hot and moist this hand of yours requires a sequester from liberty fasting and prayer much castigation exercise devout for here 's a young and sweating devil here that commonly rebels tis a good hand a frank one you may indeed say so for twas that hand that gave away my heart a liberal hand the hearts of old gave hands but our new heraldry is hands not hearts i can not speak of this come now your promise what promise chuck i have sent to bid cassio come speak with you i have a salt and sorry rheum offends me lend me thy handkerchief here my lord that which i gave you i have it not about me not no indeed my lord that is a fault that handkerchief did an egyptian to my mother give she was a charmer and could almost read the thoughts of people she told her while she kept it twould make her amiable and subdue my father entirely to her love but if she lost it or made gift of it my father 's eye should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt after new fancies she dying gave it me and bid me when my fate would have me wive to give it her i did so and take heed on't make it a darling like your precious eye to lose't or give't away were such perdition as nothing else could match is't possible tis true there 's magic in the web of it a sibyl that had number'd in the world the sun to course two hundred compasses in her prophetic fury sew'd the work the worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk and it was dyed in mummy which the skilful conserved of maidens hearts indeed is't true most veritable therefore look to't well then would to god that i had never seen't ha wherefore why do you speak so startingly and rash is't lost is't gone speak is it out o the way heaven bless us say you it is not lost but what an if it were how i say it is not lost fetch't let me see't why so i can sir but i will not now this is a trick to put me from my suit pray you let cassio be received again fetch me the handkerchief my mind misgives come come you 'll never meet a more sufficient man the handkerchief i pray talk me of cassio the handkerchief a man that all his time hath founded his good fortunes on your love shared dangers with you,-- the handkerchief in sooth you are to blame away exit is not this man jealous i ne'er saw this before sure there 's some wonder in this handkerchief i am most unhappy in the loss of it tis not a year or two shows us a man they are all but stomachs and we all but food to eat us hungerly and when they are full they belch us look you cassio and my husband enter cassio and iago there is no other way tis she must do't and lo the happiness go and importune her how now good cassio what 's the news with you madam my former suit i do beseech you that by your virtuous means i may again exist and be a member of his love whom i with all the office of my heart entirely honour i would not be delay'd if my offence be of such mortal kind that nor my service past nor present sorrows nor purposed merit in futurity can ransom me into his love again but to know so must be my benefit so shall i clothe me in a forced content and shut myself up in some other course to fortune 's alms alas thrice gentle cassio my advocation is not now in tune my lord is not my lord nor should i know him were he in favour as in humour alter'd so help me every spirit sanctified as i have spoken for you all my best and stood within the blank of his displeasure for my free speech you must awhile be patient what i can do i will and more i will than for myself i dare let that suffice you is my lord angry he went hence but now and certainly in strange unquietness can he be angry i have seen the cannon when it hath blown his ranks into the air and like the devil from his very arm puff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry something of moment then i will go meet him there 's matter in't indeed if he be angry i prithee do so exit iago something sure of state either from venice or some unhatch'd practise made demonstrable here in cyprus to him hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases men 's natures wrangle with inferior things though great ones are their object tis even so for let our finger ache and it indues our other healthful members even to that sense of pain nay we must think men are not gods nor of them look for such observances as fit the bridal beshrew me much emilia i was unhandsome warrior as i am arraigning his unkindness with my soul but now i find i had suborn'd the witness and he 's indicted falsely pray heaven it be state matters as you think and no conception nor no jealous toy concerning you alas the day i never gave him cause but jealous souls will not be answer'd so they are not ever jealous for the cause but jealous for they are jealous tis a monster begot upon itself born on itself heaven keep that monster from othello 's mind lady amen i will go seek him cassio walk hereabout if i do find him fit i 'll move your suit and seek to effect it to my uttermost i humbly thank your ladyship exeunt desdemona and emilia enter bianca save you friend cassio what make you from home how is it with you my most fair bianca i faith sweet love i was coming to your house and i was going to your lodging cassio what keep a week away seven days and nights eight score eight hours and lovers absent hours more tedious than the dial eight score times o weary reckoning pardon me bianca i have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd but i shall in a more continuate time strike off this score of absence sweet bianca giving her desdemona 's handkerchief take me this work out o cassio whence came this this is some token from a newer friend to the felt absence now i feel a cause is't come to this well well go to woman throw your vile guesses in the devil 's teeth from whence you have them you are jealous now that this is from some mistress some remembrance no in good troth bianca why whose is it i know not sweet i found it in my chamber i like the work well ere it be demanded-- as like enough it will i'ld have it copied take it and do't and leave me for this time leave you wherefore i do attend here on the general and think it no addition nor my wish to have him see me woman'd why i pray you not that i love you not but that you do not love me i pray you bring me on the way a little and say if i shall see you soon at night tis but a little way that i can bring you for i attend here but i 'll see you soon tis very good i must be circumstanced exeunt act iv scene i. cyprus before the castle enter othello and iago will you think so think so iago what to kiss in private an unauthorized kiss or to be naked with her friend in bed an hour or more not meaning any harm naked in bed iago and not mean harm it is hypocrisy against the devil they that mean virtuously and yet do so the devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven so they do nothing tis a venial slip but if i give my wife a handkerchief,-- what then why then tis hers my lord and being hers she may i think bestow't on any man she is protectress of her honour too may she give that her honour is an essence that 's not seen they have it very oft that have it not but for the handkerchief,-- by heaven i would most gladly have forgot it thou said'st it comes o'er my memory as doth the raven o'er the infected house boding to all he had my handkerchief ay what of that that 's not so good now what if i had said i had seen him do you wrong or heard him say,--as knaves be such abroad who having by their own importunate suit or voluntary dotage of some mistress convinced or supplied them can not choose but they must blab-- hath he said any thing he hath my lord but be you well assured no more than he 'll unswear what hath he said faith that he did i know not what he did what what lie-- with her with her on her what you will lie with her lie on her we say lie on her when they belie her lie with her that 's fulsome --handkerchief confessions handkerchief!--to confess and be hanged for his labour;--first to be hanged and then to confess.--i tremble at it nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction it is not words that shake me thus pish noses ears and lips --is't possible?--confess handkerchief!--o devil!-- falls in a trance work on my medicine work thus credulous fools are caught and many worthy and chaste dames even thus all guiltless meet reproach what ho my lord my lord i say othello enter cassio how now cassio what 's the matter my lord is fall'n into an epilepsy this is his second fit he had one yesterday rub him about the temples no forbear the lethargy must have his quiet course if not he foams at mouth and by and by breaks out to savage madness look he stirs do you withdraw yourself a little while he will recover straight when he is gone i would on great occasion speak with you exit cassio how is it general have you not hurt your head dost thou mock me i mock you no by heaven would you would bear your fortune like a man a horned man 's a monster and a beast there 's many a beast then in a populous city and many a civil monster did he confess it good sir be a man think every bearded fellow that 's but yoked may draw with you there 's millions now alive that nightly lie in those unproper beds which they dare swear peculiar your case is better o tis the spite of hell the fiend 's arch mock to lip a wanton in a secure couch and to suppose her chaste no let me know and knowing what i am i know what she shall be o thou art wise tis certain stand you awhile apart confine yourself but in a patient list whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief-- a passion most unsuiting such a man-- cassio came hither i shifted him away and laid good scuse upon your ecstasy bade him anon return and here speak with me the which he promised do but encave yourself and mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns that dwell in every region of his face for i will make him tell the tale anew where how how oft how long ago and when he hath and is again to cope your wife i say but mark his gesture marry patience or i shall say you are all in all in spleen and nothing of a man dost thou hear iago i will be found most cunning in my patience but dost thou hear?--most bloody that 's not amiss but yet keep time in all will you withdraw othello retires now will i question cassio of bianca a housewife that by selling her desires buys herself bread and clothes it is a creature that dotes on cassio as tis the strumpet 's plague to beguile many and be beguiled by one he when he hears of her can not refrain from the excess of laughter here he comes re enter cassio as he shall smile othello shall go mad and his unbookish jealousy must construe poor cassio 's smiles gestures and light behavior quite in the wrong how do you now lieutenant the worser that you give me the addition whose want even kills me ply desdemona well and you are sure on't speaking lower now if this suit lay in bianco 's power how quickly should you speed alas poor caitiff look how he laughs already i never knew woman love man so alas poor rogue i think i faith she loves me now he denies it faintly and laughs it out do you hear cassio now he importunes him to tell it o'er go to well said well said she gives it out that you shall marry hey do you intend it ha ha ha do you triumph roman do you triumph i marry her what a customer prithee bear some charity to my wit do not think it so unwholesome ha ha ha so so so so they laugh that win faith the cry goes that you shall marry her prithee say true i am a very villain else have you scored me well this is the monkey 's own giving out she is persuaded i will marry her out of her own love and flattery not out of my promise iago beckons me now he begins the story she was here even now she haunts me in every place i was the other day talking on the sea bank with certain venetians and thither comes the bauble and by this hand she falls me thus about my neck-- crying o dear cassio as it were his gesture imports it so hangs and lolls and weeps upon me so hales and pulls me ha ha ha now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber o i see that nose of yours but not that dog i shall throw it to well i must leave her company before me look where she comes tis such another fitchew marry a perfumed one enter bianca what do you mean by this haunting of me let the devil and his dam haunt you what did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now i was a fine fool

was that mine yours by this hand and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife she gave it him and he hath given it his whore i would have him nine years a killing a fine woman a fair woman a sweet woman nay you must forget that ay let her rot and perish and be damned to night for she shall not live no my heart is turned to stone i strike it and it hurts my hand o the world hath not a sweeter creature she might lie by an emperor 's side and command him tasks nay that 's not your way hang her i do but say what she is so delicate with her needle an admirable musician o she will sing the savageness out of a bear of so high and plenteous wit and invention:-- she 's the worse for all this o a thousand thousand times and then of so gentle a condition ay too gentle nay that 's certain

not i would to heaven he were what strike his wife faith that was not so well yet would i knew that stroke would prove the worst is it his use or did the letters work upon his blood and new create this fault alas alas it is not honesty in me to speak what i have seen and known you shall observe him and his own courses will denote him so that i may save my speech do but go after and mark how he continues i am sorry that i am deceived in him exeunt scene ii a room in the castle enter othello and emilia you have seen nothing then nor ever heard nor ever did suspect yes you have seen cassio and she together but then i saw no harm and then i heard each syllable that breath made up between them what did they never whisper never my lord nor send you out o the way never to fetch her fan her gloves her mask nor nothing never my lord that 's strange i durst my lord to wager she is honest lay down my soul at stake if you think other remove your thought it doth abuse your bosom if any wretch have put this in your head let heaven requite it with the serpent 's curse for if she be not honest chaste and true there 's no man happy the purest of their wives is foul as slander bid her come

night show it if thou the next night following enjoy not desdemona take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life well what is it is it within reason and compass sir there is especial commission come from venice to depute cassio in othello 's place is that true why then othello and desdemona return again to venice o no he goes into mauritania and takes away with him the fair desdemona unless his abode be lingered here by some accident wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of cassio how do you mean removing of him why by making him uncapable of othello 's place knocking out his brains and that you would have me to do ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right he sups to night with a harlotry and thither will i go to him he knows not yet of his horrorable fortune if you will watch his going thence which i will fashion to fall out between twelve and one you may take him at your pleasure i will be near to second your attempt and he shall fall

he will return incontinent he hath commanded me to go to bed and bade me to dismiss you dismiss me it was his bidding therefore good emilia give me my nightly wearing and adieu we must not now displease him i would you had never seen him so would not i \t my love doth so approve him that even his stubbornness his cheques his frowns-- prithee unpin me,--have grace and favour in them i have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed all 's one good faith how foolish are our minds if i do die before thee prithee shroud me in one of those same sheets come come you talk my mother had a maid call'd barbara she was in love and he she loved proved mad and did forsake her she had a song of willow an old thing twas but it express'd her fortune and she died singing it that song to night will not go from my mind i have much to do but to go hang my head all at one side and sing it like poor barbara prithee dispatch shall i go fetch your night gown no unpin me here this lodovico is a proper man a very handsome man he speaks well i know a lady in venice would have walked barefoot to palestine for a touch of his nether lip singing   the poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree sing all a green willow her hand on her bosom her head on her knee sing willow willow willow the fresh streams ran by her and murmur'd her moans sing willow willow willow her salt tears fell from her and soften'd the stones lay by these:-- singing sing willow willow willow prithee hie thee he 'll come anon:-- singing sing all a green willow must be my garland let nobody blame him his scorn i approve,- nay that 's not next.--hark who is't that knocks it 's the wind singing   i call'd my love false love but what said he then sing willow willow willow if i court moe women you 'll couch with moe men so get thee gone good night ate eyes do itch doth that bode weeping tis neither here nor there i have heard it said so o these men these men dost thou in conscience think,--tell me emilia,-- that there be women do abuse their husbands in such gross kind there be some such no question wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world why would not you no by this heavenly light nor i neither by this heavenly light i might do't as well i the dark wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world the world 's a huge thing it is a great price for a small vice in troth i think thou wouldst not in troth i think i should and undo't when i had done marry i would not do such a thing for a joint ring nor for measures of lawn nor for gowns petticoats nor caps nor any petty exhibition but for the whole world,--why who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch i should venture purgatory for't beshrew me if i would do such a wrong for the whole world why the wrong is but a wrong i the world and having the world for your labour tis a wrong in your own world and you might quickly make it right i do not think there is any such woman yes a dozen and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for but i do think it is their husbands faults if wives do fall say that they slack their duties and pour our treasures into foreign laps or else break out in peevish jealousies throwing restraint upon us or say they strike us or scant our former having in despite why we have galls and though we have some grace yet have we some revenge let husbands know their wives have sense like them they see and smell and have their palates both for sweet and sour as husbands have what is it that they do when they change us for others is it sport i think it is and doth affection breed it i think it doth is't frailty that thus errs it is so too and have not we affections desires for sport and frailty as men have then let them use us well else let them know the ills we do their ills instruct us so good night good night heaven me such uses send not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend exeunt act v scene i. cyprus a street enter iago and roderigo here stand behind

's wedded her husband banish'd she imprison'd all is outward sorrow though i think the king be touch'd at very heart none but the king he that hath lost her too so is the queen that most desired the match but not a courtier although they wear their faces to the bent of the king 's look 's hath a heart that is not glad at the thing they scowl at and why so he that hath miss'd the princess is a thing too bad for bad report and he that hath her-- i mean that married her alack good man and therefore banish'd is a creature such as to seek through the regions of the earth for one his like there

he is i honour him even out of your report but pray you tell me is she sole child to the king his only child he had two sons if this be worth your hearing mark it the eldest of them at three years old i the swathing clothes the other from their nursery were stol'n and to this hour no guess in knowledge which way they went how long is this ago some twenty years that a king 's children should be so

you speak with me you shall at least go see my lord aboard for this time leave me exeunt scene ii the same a public place enter cloten and two lords sir i would advise you to shift a shirt the violence of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice where air comes out air comes in there 's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent if my shirt were bloody then to shift it have i hurt him aside   no faith not so much as his patience hurt him his body 's a passable carcass if he be not hurt it is a thoroughfare for steel if it be not hurt aside   his steel was in debt it went o the backside the town the villain would not stand me aside   no but he fled forward still toward your face stand you you have land enough of your own but he added to your having gave you some ground aside   as many inches as you have oceans puppies i would they had not come between us aside   so would i till you had measured how long a fool you were upon the ground and that she should love this fellow and refuse me aside   if it be a sin to make a true election she is damned sir as i told you always her beauty and her brain go not together she 's a good sign but i have seen small reflection of her wit aside   she shines not upon fools lest the reflection should hurt her come i 'll to my chamber would there had been some hurt done aside   i wish not so unless it had been the fall of an ass which is no great hurt you 'll go with us i 'll attend your lordship nay come let 's go together well my lord exeunt scene iii a room in cymbeline 's palace enter imogen and pisanio i would thou grew'st unto the shores o the haven and question'dst every sail if he should write and not have it twere a paper lost as offer'd mercy is what was the last that he spake to thee it was his queen his queen then waved his handkerchief and kiss'd it madam senseless linen happier therein than i and that was all no madam for so long as he could make me with this eye or ear distinguish him from others he did keep the deck with glove or hat or handkerchief still waving as the fits and stirs of 's mind could best express how slow his soul sail'd on how swift his ship thou shouldst have made him as little as a crow or less ere left to after eye him madam so i did i would have broke mine eye strings crack'd them but to look upon him till the diminution of space had pointed him sharp as my needle nay follow'd him till he had melted from the smallness of a gnat to air and then have turn'd mine eye and wept but good pisanio when shall we hear from him be assured madam with his next vantage i did not take my leave of him but had most pretty things to say ere i could tell him how i would think on him at certain hours such thoughts and such or i could make him swear the she s of italy should not betray mine interest and his honour or have charged him at the sixth hour of morn at noon at midnight to encounter me with orisons for then i am in heaven for him or ere i could give him that parting kiss which i had set betwixt two charming words comes in my father and like the tyrannous breathing of the north shakes all our buds from growing enter a lady the queen madam desires your highness company those things i bid you do get them dispatch'd i will attend the queen madam i shall exeunt scene iv rome philario 's house enter philario iachimo a frenchman a dutchman and a spaniard believe it sir i have seen him in britain he was then of a crescent note expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of but i could then have looked on him without the help of admiration though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side and i to peruse him by items you speak of him when he was less furnished than now he is with that which makes him both without and within i have seen him in france we had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he this matter of marrying his king 's daughter wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own words him i doubt not a great deal from the matter and then his banishment ay and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him be it but to fortify her judgment which else an easy battery might lay flat for taking a beggar without less quality but how comes it he is to sojourn with you how creeps acquaintance his father and i were soldiers together to whom i have been often bound for no less than my life here comes the briton let him be so entertained amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his quality enter posthumus leonatus i beseech you all be better known to this gentleman whom i commend to you as a noble friend of mine how worthy he is i will leave to appear hereafter rather than story him in his own hearing sir we have known together in orleans since when i have been debtor to you for courtesies which i will be ever to pay and yet pay still sir you o'er rate my poor kindness i was glad i did atone my countryman and you it had been pity you should have been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature by your pardon sir i was then a young traveller rather shunned to go even with what i heard than in my every action to be guided by others experiences but upon my mended judgment if i offend not to say it is mended my quarrel was not altogether slight faith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other or have fallen both can we with manners ask what was the difference safely i think twas a contention in public which may without contradiction suffer the report it was much like an argument that fell out last night where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses this gentleman at that time vouching and upon warrant of bloody affirmation his to be more fair virtuous wise chaste constant qualified and less attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in france that lady is not now living or this gentleman 's opinion by this worn out she holds her virtue still and i my mind you must not so far prefer her fore ours of italy being so far provoked as i was in france i would abate her nothing though i profess myself her adorer not her friend as fair and as good a kind of hand in hand comparison had been something too fair and too good for any lady in britain if she went before others i have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres many i have beheld i could not but believe she excelled many but i have not seen the most precious diamond that is nor you the lady i praised her as i rated her so do i my stone what do you esteem it at more than the world enjoys either your unparagoned mistress is dead or she 's outprized by a trifle you are mistaken the one may be sold or given if there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift the other is not a thing for sale and only the gift of the gods which the gods have given you which by their graces i will keep you may wear her in title yours but you know strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds your ring may be stolen too so your brace of unprizable estimations the one is but frail and the other casual a cunning thief or a that way accomplished courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last your italy contains none so accomplished a courtier to convince the honour of my mistress if in the holding or loss of that you term her frail i do nothing doubt you have store of thieves notwithstanding i fear not my ring let us leave here gentlemen sir with all my heart this worthy signior i thank him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at first with five times so much conversation i should get ground of your fair mistress make her go back even to the yielding had i admittance and opportunity to friend no no i dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring which in my opinion o'ervalues it something but i make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation and to bar your offence herein too i durst attempt it against any lady in the world you are a great deal abused in too bold a persuasion and i doubt not you sustain what you 're worthy of by your attempt what 's that a repulse though your attempt as you call it deserve more a punishment too gentlemen enough of this it came in too suddenly let it die as it was born and i pray you be better acquainted would i had put my estate and my neighbour 's on the approbation of what i have spoke what lady would you choose to assail yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe i will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that commend me to the court where your lady is with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference and i will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved i will wage against your gold gold to it my ring i hold dear as my finger tis part of it you are afraid and therein the wiser if you buy ladies flesh at a million a dram you can not preserve it from tainting but i see you have some religion in you that you fear this is but a custom in your tongue you bear a graver purpose i hope i am the master of my speeches and would undergo what 's spoken i swear will you i shall but lend my diamond till your return let there be covenants drawn between 's my mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking i dare you to this match here 's my ring i will have it no lay by the gods it is one if i bring you no sufficient testimony that i have enjoyed the dearest bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand ducats are yours so is your diamond too if i come off and leave her in such honour as you have trust in she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are yours provided i have your commendation for my more free entertainment i embrace these conditions let us have articles betwixt us only thus far you shall answer if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly to understand you have prevailed i am no further your enemy she is not worth our debate if she remain unseduced you not making it appear otherwise for your ill opinion and the assault you have made to her chastity you shall answer me with your sword your hand a covenant we will have these things set down by lawful counsel and straight away for britain lest the bargain should catch cold and starve i will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded agreed exeunt posthumus leonatus and iachimo will this hold think you signior iachimo will not from it pray let us

bids me ask wherefore you have commanded of me those most poisonous compounds which are the movers of a languishing death but though slow deadly i wonder doctor thou ask'st me such a question have i not been thy pupil long hast thou not learn'd me how to make perfumes distil preserve yea so that our great king himself doth woo me oft for my confections having thus far proceeded,-- unless thou think'st me devilish is't not meet that i did amplify my judgment in other conclusions i will try the forces of these thy compounds on such creatures as we count not worth the hanging but none human to try the vigour of them and apply allayments to their act and by them gather their several virtues and effects your highness shall from this practise but make hard your heart besides the seeing these effects will be both noisome and infectious o content thee enter pisanio aside here comes a flattering rascal upon him will i first work he 's for his master an enemy to my son how now pisanio

think she has strange lingering poisons i do know her spirit and will not trust one of her malice with a drug of such damn'd nature those she has will stupefy and dull the sense awhile which first perchance she 'll prove on cats and dogs then afterward up higher but there is no danger in what show of death it makes more than the locking up the spirits a time to be more fresh reviving she is fool'd with a most false effect and i the truer so to be false with her no further service doctor until i send for thee i humbly take my leave exit weeps she still say'st thou dost thou think in time

comes comes to decay a day 's work in him what shalt thou expect to be depender on a thing that leans who can not be new built nor has no friends so much as but to prop him the queen drops the box pisanio takes it up thou takest up thou know'st not what but take it for thy labour it is a thing i made which hath the king five times redeem'd from death i do not know what is more cordial nay i prethee take it it is an earnest of a further good that i mean to thee tell thy mistress how the case stands with her do't as from thyself think what a chance thou changest on but think thou hast thy mistress still to boot my son who shall take notice of thee i 'll move the king to any shape of thy preferment such as thou'lt desire and then myself i chiefly that set thee on to this desert am bound to load thy merit richly call my women think on my words exit pisanio a sly and constant knave not to be shaked the agent for his master and the remembrancer of her to hold the hand fast to her lord i

languish for assured bondage will my lord say so ay madam with his eyes in flood with laughter it is a recreation to be by and hear him mock the frenchman but heavens know some men are much to blame not he i hope not he but yet heaven 's bounty towards him might be used more thankfully in himself tis much in you which i account his beyond all talents whilst i am bound to wonder i am bound to pity too what do you pity sir two creatures heartily am i one sir you look on me what wreck discern you in me deserves your pity lamentable what to hide me from the radiant sun and solace i the dungeon by a snuff i pray you sir deliver with more openness your answers to my demands why do you pity me that others do-- i was about to say enjoy your but it is an office of the gods to venge it not mine to speak on t. you do seem to know something of me or what concerns me pray you,-- since doubling things go ill often hurts more than to be sure they do for certainties either are past remedies or timely knowing the remedy then born discover to me what both you spur and stop had i this cheek to bathe my lips upon this hand whose touch whose every touch would force the feeler 's soul to the oath of loyalty this object which takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye fixing it only here should i damn'd then slaver with lips as common as the stairs that mount the capitol join gripes with hands

ramps in your despite upon your purse revenge it i dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure more noble than that runagate to your bed and will continue fast to your affection still close as sure what ho pisanio let me my service tender on your lips away i do condemn mine ears that have so long attended thee if thou wert honourable thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue not for such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange thou wrong'st a gentleman who is as far from thy report as thou from honour and solicit'st here a lady that disdains thee and the devil alike what ho pisanio the king my father shall be made acquainted of thy assault if he shall think it fit a saucy stranger in his court to mart as in a romish stew and to expound his beastly mind to us he hath a court he little cares

caesar 's praises no whit less than in his feats deserving it for him and his succession granted rome a tribute yearly three thousand pounds which by thee lately is left untender'd and to kill the marvel shall be so ever there be many caesars ere such another julius britain is a world by itself and we will nothing pay for wearing our own noses that opportunity which then they had to take from 's to resume we have again remember sir my liege the kings your ancestors together with the natural bravery of your isle which stands as neptune 's park ribbed and paled in with rocks unscalable and roaring waters with sands that will not bear your enemies boats but suck them up to the topmast a kind of conquest caesar made here but made not here his brag of came and saw and overcame with shame-- that first that ever touch'd him he was carried from off our coast twice beaten and his shipping-- poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas like egg shells moved upon their surges crack'd as easily gainst our rocks for joy whereof the famed cassibelan who was once at point-- o giglot fortune!--to master caesar 's sword made lud 's town with rejoicing fires bright and britons strut with courage come there 's no more tribute to be paid our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time and as i said there is no moe such caesars other of them may have crook'd noses but to owe such straight arms none son let your mother end we have yet many among us can gripe as hard as cassibelan i do not say i am one but i have a hand why tribute why should we pay tribute if caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket or put the moon in his pocket we will pay him tribute for light else sir no more tribute pray you now you must know till the injurious romans did extort this tribute from us we were free caesar 's ambition which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch the sides o the world against all colour here did put the yoke upon 's which to shake off becomes a warlike people whom we reckon ourselves to be we do say then to caesar our ancestor was that mulmutius which ordain'd our laws whose use the sword of caesar hath too much mangled whose repair and franchise shall by the power we hold be our good deed though rome be therefore angry mulmutius made our laws who was the first of britain which did put his brows within a golden crown and call'd himself a king

name pronounce i gainst thee look for fury not to be resisted thus defied i thank thee for myself thou art welcome caius thy caesar knighted me my youth i spent much under him of him i gather'd honour which he to seek of me again perforce behoves me keep at utterance i am perfect that the pannonians and dalmatians for their liberties are now in arms a precedent which not to read would show the britons cold so caesar shall not find them let proof speak his majesty bids you welcome make pastime with us a day or two or longer if you seek us afterwards in other terms you shall find us in our

and executioner all himself for we do fear the law what company discover you abroad no single soul can we set eye on but in all safe reason he must have some attendants though his humour was nothing

enemy full hearted lolling the tongue with slaughtering having work more plentiful than tools to do't struck down some mortally some slightly touch'd some falling merely through fear that the straight pass was damm'd with dead men hurt behind and cowards living to die with lengthen'd shame where was this lane close by the battle ditch'd and wall'd with turf which gave advantage to an ancient soldier an honest one i warrant who deserved so long a breeding as his white beard came to in doing this for 's country athwart the lane he with two striplings lads more like to run the country base

like his ancestry moulded the stuff so fair that he deserved the praise o the world as great sicilius heir when once he was mature for man in britain where was he that could stand up his parallel or fruitful object be in eye of imogen that best could deem his dignity with marriage wherefore was he mock'd to be exiled and thrown from leonati seat and cast from her his dearest one sweet imogen why did you suffer iachimo slight thing of italy to taint his nobler heart and brain with needless jealosy and to become the geck and scorn o th other 's villany for this from stiller seats we came our

unlike our courtiers as good as promise reads when as a lion 's whelp shall to himself unknown without seeking find and be embraced by a piece of tender air and when from a stately cedar shall be lopped branches which being dead many years shall after revive be jointed to the old stock and freshly grow then shall posthumus end his miseries britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty

it which i 'll keep if but for sympathy re enter first gaoler come sir are you ready for death over roasted rather ready long ago hanging is the word sir if you be ready for that you are well cooked so if i prove a good repast to the spectators the dish pays the shot a heavy reckoning for you sir but the comfort is you shall be called to no more payments fear no more tavern bills which are often the sadness of parting as the procuring of mirth you come in flint for want of meat depart reeling with too much drink sorry that you have paid too much and sorry that you are paid too much purse and brain both empty the brain the heavier for being too light the purse too light being drawn of heaviness of this contradiction you shall now be quit o the charity of a penny cord it sums up thousands in a trice you have no true debitor and creditor but it of what 's past is and to come the discharge your neck sir is pen book and counters so the acquittance follows i am merrier to die than thou art to live indeed sir he that sleeps feels not the tooth ache but a man that were to sleep your sleep and a hangman to help him to bed i think he would change places with his officer for look you sir you know not which way you shall go yes indeed do i fellow your death has eyes in 's head then i have not seen him so pictured you must either be directed by some that take upon them to know or do take upon yourself that which i am sure you do not know or jump the after inquiry on your own peril and how you shall speed in your journey 's end i think you 'll never return to tell one i tell thee fellow there are none want eyes to direct them the way i am going but such as wink and will not use them what an infinite mock is this that a man should have the best use of eyes to see the way of

in one that promises nought but beggary and poor looks no tidings of him he hath been search'd among the dead and living but no trace of him to my grief i am the heir of his reward to belarius guiderius and arviragus which i will add to you the liver heart and brain of britain by whom i grant she lives tis now the time to ask of whence you are report it sir in cambria are we born and

horror madly dying like her life which being cruel to the world concluded most cruel to herself what she confess'd i will report so please you these her women can trip me if i err who with wet cheeks were present when she finish'd prithee say first she confess'd she never loved you only affected greatness got by you not you married your royalty was wife to your place abhorr'd your person she alone knew this and but she spoke it dying i would not believe her lips in opening it proceed your daughter whom she bore in hand to love with such integrity she did confess was as a scorpion to her sight whose life but that her flight prevented it she had ta'en off by poison o most delicate fiend who is t can read a woman is there more more sir and worse she did confess she had for you a mortal mineral which being took should by the minute feed on life and lingering by inches waste you in which time she purposed by watching weeping tendance kissing to o'ercome you with her show and in time when she had fitted you with her craft to work her son into the adoption of the crown but failing of her end by his strange absence grew shameless desperate open'd in despite of heaven and men her purposes repented the evils she hatch'd were not effected so despairing died heard you all this her women we did so please your highness mine eyes were not in fault for she was beautiful mine ears that heard her flattery nor my heart that thought her like her seeming it had been vicious to have mistrusted her yet o my daughter that it was folly in me thou mayst say and prove it in thy feeling heaven mend all enter lucius iachimo the soothsayer and other   roman prisoners guarded posthumus leonatus behind and imogen thou comest not caius now for tribute that the britons have razed out though with the loss of many a bold one whose kinsmen have made suit that their good souls may be appeased with slaughter of you their captives which ourself have granted so think of your estate consider sir the chance of war the day was yours by accident had it gone with us we should not when the blood was cool have threaten'd our prisoners with the sword but since the gods will have it thus that nothing but our lives may be call'd ransom let it come sufficeth a roman with a roman 's heart can suffer augustus lives to think on't and so much for my peculiar care this one thing only i will entreat my boy a briton born let him be ransom'd never master had a page so kind so duteous diligent so tender over his occasions true so feat so nurse like let his virtue join with my request which i make bold your highness can not deny he hath done no briton harm though he have served a roman save him sir and spare no blood beside i have surely seen him his favour is familiar to me boy thou hast look'd thyself into my grace and art mine own i know not why wherefore to say live boy ne'er thank thy master live and ask of cymbeline what boon thou wilt fitting my bounty and thy state i 'll give it yea though thou do demand a prisoner the noblest ta'en i humbly thank your highness i do not bid thee beg my life good lad and yet i know thou wilt no no alack there 's other work in hand i see a thing bitter to me as death your life good master must shuffle for itself the boy disdains me he leaves me scorns me briefly die their joys that place them on the truth of girls and boys why stands he so perplex'd what wouldst thou boy i love thee more and more think more and more what 's best to ask know'st him thou look'st on speak wilt have him live is he thy kin thy friend he is a roman no more kin to me than i to your highness who being born your vassal am something nearer wherefore eyest him so i 'll tell you sir in private if you please to give me hearing ay with all my heart and lend my best attention what 's thy name fidele sir thou'rt my good youth my page i 'll be thy master walk with me speak freely cymbeline and imogen converse apart is not this boy revived from death one sand another not more resembles that sweet rosy lad who died and was fidele what think you the same dead thing alive peace peace see further he eyes us not forbear creatures may be alike were t he i am sure he would have spoke to us but we saw him dead be silent let 's see further aside \t it is my mistress since she is living let the time run on to good or bad cymbeline and imogen come forward come stand thou by our side make thy demand aloud to iachimo sir step you forth give answer to this boy and do it freely or by our greatness and the grace of it which is our honour bitter torture shall winnow the truth from falsehood on speak to him my boon is that this gentleman may render of whom he had this ring aside                  what 's that to him that diamond upon your finger say how came it yours thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that which to be spoke would torture thee how me i am glad to be constrain'd to utter that which torments me to conceal by villany i got this ring twas leonatus jewel whom thou didst banish and which more may grieve thee as it doth me a nobler sir ne'er lived twixt sky and ground wilt thou hear more my lord all that belongs to this that paragon thy daughter,-- for whom my heart drops blood and my false spirits quail to remember give me leave i faint my daughter what of her renew thy strength i had rather thou shouldst live while nature will than die ere i hear more strive man and speak upon a time,--unhappy was the clock that struck the hour!--it was in rome,--accursed the mansion where!--'twas at a feast,--o would our viands had been poison'd or at least those which i heaved to head!--the good posthumus-- what should i say he was too good to be where ill men were and was the best of all amongst the rarest of good ones,--sitting sadly hearing us praise our loves of italy for beauty that made barren the swell'd boast of him that best could speak for feature laming the shrine of venus or straight pight minerva postures beyond brief nature for condition a shop of all the qualities that man loves woman for besides that hook of wiving fairness which strikes the eye-- i stand on fire come to the matter all too soon i shall unless thou wouldst grieve quickly this posthumus most like a noble lord in love and one that had a royal lover took his hint and not dispraising whom we praised,--therein he was as calm as virtue he began his mistress picture which by his tongue being made and then a mind put in't either our brags were crack'd of kitchen trolls or his description proved us unspeaking sots nay nay to the purpose your daughter 's chastity there it begins he spake of her as dian had hot dreams and she alone were cold whereat i wretch made scruple of his praise and wager'd with him pieces of gold gainst this which then he wore upon his honour'd finger to attain in suit the place of 's bed and win this ring by hers and mine adultery he true knight no lesser of her honour confident than i did truly find her stakes this ring and would so had it been a carbuncle of phoebus wheel and might so safely had it been all the worth of 's car away to britain post i in this design well may you sir remember me at court where i was taught of your chaste daughter the wide difference twixt amorous and villanous being thus quench'd of hope not longing mine italian brain gan in your duller britain operate most vilely for my vantage excellent and to be brief my practise so prevail'd that i return'd with simular proof enough to make the noble leonatus mad by wounding his belief in her renown with tokens thus and thus averting notes of chamber hanging pictures this her bracelet,-- o cunning how i got it!--nay some marks of secret on her person that he could not but think her bond of chastity quite crack'd i having ta'en the forfeit whereupon-- methinks i see him now-- advancing              ay so thou dost italian fiend ay me most credulous fool egregious murderer thief any thing that 's due to all the villains past in being to come o give me cord or knife or poison some upright justicer thou king send out for torturers ingenious it is i that all the abhorred things o the earth amend by being worse than they i am posthumus that kill'd thy daughter:--villain like i lie-- that caused a lesser villain than myself a sacrilegious thief to do't the temple of virtue was she yea and she herself spit and throw stone s cast mire upon me set the dogs o the street to bay me every villain be call'd posthumus leonitus and be villany less than twas o imogen my queen my life my wife o imogen imogen imogen

til now help help mine honour'd lady does the world go round how come these staggers on me wake my mistress if this be so the gods do mean to strike me to death with mortal joy how fares thy mistress o get thee from my sight thou gavest me poison dangerous fellow hence breathe not where princes are the tune of imogen lady the gods throw stones of sulphur on me if that box i gave you was not thought by me a precious thing i had it from the queen new matter still it poison'd me o gods i left out one thing which the queen confess'd which must approve thee honest if pisanio have said she given his mistress that confection which i gave him for cordial she is served as i would serve a rat what 's this comelius the queen sir very oft importuned me to temper poisons for her still pretending the satisfaction of her knowledge only in killing creatures vile as cats and dogs of no esteem i dreading that her purpose was of more danger did compound for her a certain stuff which being ta'en would cease the present power of life but in short time all offices of nature should again do their due functions have you ta'en of it most like i did for i was dead my boys there was our error this is sure fidele why did you throw your wedded lady from you think that you are upon a rock and now throw me again embracing him hang there like a fruit my soul till the tree die how now my flesh my child what makest thou me a dullard in this act wilt thou not speak to me kneeling                your blessing sir to guiderius and arviragus   though you did love this youth i blame ye not

which way she was gone it was my instant death by accident had a feigned letter of my master 's then in my pocket which directed him to seek her on the mountains near to milford where in a frenzy in my master 's garments which he enforced from me away he posts with unchaste purpose and with oath to violate my lady 's honour what became of him i further know not let me end the story i slew him there marry the gods forfend i would not thy good deeds should from my lips pluck a bard sentence prithee valiant youth deny't again i have spoke it and i did it he was a prince a most incivil one the wrongs he did me were nothing prince like for he did provoke me with language that would make me spurn the sea if it could so roar to me i cut off 's head and am right glad he is not standing here to tell this tale of mine i am sorry for thee by thine own tongue thou art condemn'd and must endure our law thou'rt dead that headless man i thought had been my lord bind the offender and take him from our presence stay sir king this man is better than the man he slew as well descended as thyself and hath more of thee merited than a band of clotens had ever scar for to the guard let his arms alone they were not born for bondage why old soldier wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for by tasting of our wrath how of descent as good as we in that he spake too far and thou shalt die for't we will die all three but i will prove that two on 's are as good as i have given out him my sons i must for mine own part unfold a dangerous speech though haply well for you your danger 's ours and our good his have at it then by leave thou hadst great king a subject who was call'd belarius what of him he is a banish'd traitor he it is that hath assumed this age indeed a banish'd man i know not how a traitor take him hence the whole world shall not save him not too hot first pay me for the nursing of thy sons and let it be confiscate all so soon as i have received it nursing of my sons i am too blunt and saucy here 's my knee ere i arise i will prefer my sons then spare not the old father mighty sir these two young gentlemen that call me father and think they are my sons are none of mine they are the issue of your loins my liege and blood of your begetting how my issue so sure as you your father 's i old morgan am that belarius whom you sometime banish'd your pleasure was my mere offence my punishment itself and all my treason that i suffer'd was all the harm i did these gentle princes-- for such and so they are these twenty years have i train'd up those arts they have as i could put into them my breeding was sir as your highness knows their nurse euriphile whom for the theft i wedded stole these children upon my banishment i moved her to't having received the punishment before for that which i did then beaten for loyalty excited me to treason their dear loss the more of you twas felt the more it shaped unto my end of stealing them but gracious sir here are your sons again and i must lose two of the sweet'st companions in the world the benediction of these covering heavens fall on their heads like dew for they are worthy to inlay heaven with stars thou weep'st and speak'st the service that you three have done is more unlike than this thou tell'st i lost my children if these be they i know not how to wish a pair of worthier sons be pleased awhile this gentleman whom i call polydore most worthy prince as yours is true guiderius this gentleman my cadwal arviragus your younger princely son he sir was lapp'd in a most curious mantle wrought by the hand of his queen mother which for more probation i can with ease produce guiderius had upon his neck a mole a sanguine star it was a mark of wonder this is he who hath upon him still that natural stamp it was wise nature 's end in the donation to be his evidence now o what am i a mother to the birth of three ne'er mother rejoiced deliverance more blest pray you be that after this strange starting from your orbs may reign in them now o imogen thou hast lost by this a kingdom no my lord i have got two worlds by t. o my gentle brothers have we thus met o never say hereafter but i am truest speaker you

dram she swallow'd o rare instinct when shall i hear all through this fierce abridgement hath to it circumstantial branches which distinction should be rich in where how lived you and when came you to serve our roman captive how parted with your brothers how first met them why fled you from the court and whither these and your three motives to the battle with i know not how much more should be demanded and all the other by dependencies from chance to chance but nor the time nor place will serve our long inter'gatories see posthumus anchors upon imogen and she like harmless lightning throws her eye on him her brother me her master hitting each object with a joy the counterchange is severally in all let 's quit this ground and smoke the temple with our sacrifices to belarius thou art my brother so we 'll hold thee ever you are my father too and did relieve me to see this gracious season all o'erjoy'd save these in bonds let them be joyful too for they shall taste our comfort my good master i will yet do you service happy be you the forlorn soldier that so nobly fought he would have well becomed this place and graced the thankings of a king i am sir the soldier that did company

tender less right noble burgundy when she was dear to us we did hold her so but now her price is fall'n sir there she stands if aught within that little seeming substance or all of it with our

king of france for you great king i would not from your love make such a stray to match you where i hate therefore beseech you to avert your liking a more worthier way than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed almost to acknowledge hers this is most strange that she that even but now was your best object the argument of your praise balm of your age most best most dearest should in this trice of time commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle so many folds of favour sure her offence must be of such unnatural degree that monsters it or your fore vouch'd affection fall'n into taint which to believe of her must be a faith that reason without miracle could never plant in me i yet beseech your majesty,-- if for i want that glib and oily art to speak and purpose not since what i well intend i 'll do't before i speak,--that you make known it is no vicious blot murder or foulness no unchaste action or dishonour'd step that hath deprived me of your grace and favour but even for want of that for which i am richer a still soliciting eye and such a tongue as i am glad i have not though not to have it hath lost me in your liking better thou hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better is it but this,--a tardiness in nature which often leaves the history unspoke that it intends to do my lord of burgundy what say you to the lady love 's not love when it is mingled with regards that stand aloof from the entire point will you have her she is herself a dowry royal lear give but that portion which yourself proposed and here i take cordelia by the hand duchess of burgundy nothing i have

certain and with you next month with us you see how full of changes his age is the observation we have made of it hath not been little he always loved our sister most and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly tis the infirmity of his age yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself the best and soundest of his time hath been but rash then must we look to receive from his age not alone the imperfections of long engraffed condition but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of kent 's banishment there is further compliment of leavetaking between france and him pray you let 's hit together if our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears

what is done is like an hypocrite the which is good in nothing but in sight if it be true that i interpret false then were it certain you were not so bad as with foul incest to abuse your soul where now you 're both a father and a son by your untimely claspings with your child which pleasure fits an husband not a father and she an eater of her mother 's flesh by the defiling of her parent 's bed and both like serpents are who though they feed on sweetest flowers yet they poison breed antioch farewell for wisdom sees those men blush not in actions blacker than the night will shun no course to keep them from the light one sin i know another doth provoke murder 's as near to lust as flame to smoke poison and treason are the hands of sin ay and the targets to put off the shame then lest my

melancholy be my so used a guest as not an hour in the day 's glorious walk or peaceful night the tomb where grief should sleep can breed me quiet here pleasures court mine eyes and mine eyes shun them and danger which i fear'd is at antioch whose aim seems far too short to hit me here yet neither pleasure 's art can joy my spirits nor yet the other 's distance comfort me then it is thus the passions of the mind that have their first conception by mis dread have after nourishment and life by care and what was first but fear what might be done grows elder now and cares it be not done and so with me the great antiochus gainst whom i am too little to contend since he 's so great can make his will his act will think me speaking though i swear to silence nor boots it me to say i honour him if he suspect i may dishonour him and what may make him blush in being known he 'll stop the course by which it might be known with hostile forces he 'll o'erspread the land and with the ostent of war will look so huge amazement shall drive courage from the state our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist and subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence which care of them not pity of myself who am no more but as the tops of trees which fence the roots they grow by and defend them makes both my body pine and soul to languish and punish that before that he would punish enter helicanus with other lords joy and all comfort in your sacred breast and keep your mind till you return to us peaceful and comfortable peace peace and give experience tongue they do abuse the king that flatter him for flattery is the bellows blows up sin the thing which is flatter'd but a spark to which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing whereas reproof obedient and in order fits kings as they are men for they may err when signior sooth here does proclaim a peace he flatters you makes war upon your life prince pardon me or strike me if you please i can not be much lower than my knees all leave us else but let your cares o'erlook what shipping and what lading 's in our haven and then return to us exeunt lords helicanus thou hast moved us what seest thou in our looks an angry brow dread lord if there be such a dart in princes frowns how durst thy tongue move anger to our face how dare the plants look up to heaven from whence they have their nourishment thou know'st i have power to take thy life from thee kneeling i have ground the axe myself do you but strike the blow rise prithee rise sit down thou art no flatterer i thank thee for it and heaven forbid that kings should let their ears hear their faults hid fit counsellor and servant for a prince who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant what wouldst thou have me do to bear with patience such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself thou speak'st like a physician helicanus that minister'st a potion unto me that thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself attend me then i went to antioch where as thou know'st against the face of death i sought the purchase of a glorious beauty from whence an issue i might propagate are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder the rest hark in thine ear as black as incest which by my knowledge found the sinful father seem'd not to strike but smooth but thou know'st this tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss such fear so grew in me i hither fled under the covering of a careful night who seem'd my good protector and being here bethought me what was past what might succeed i knew him tyrannous and tyrants fears decrease not but grow faster than the years and should he doubt it as no doubt he doth that i should open to the listening air how many worthy princes bloods were shed to keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope to lop that doubt he 'll fill this land with arms and make pretence of wrong that i have done him when all for mine if i may call offence must feel war 's blow who spares not innocence which love to all of which thyself art one who now reprovest me for it,-- alas sir drew sleep out of mine eyes blood from my cheeks musings into my mind with thousand doubts how i might stop this tempest ere it came and finding little comfort to relieve them i thought it princely charity to grieve them well my lord since you have given me leave to speak freely will i speak antiochus you fear and justly too i think you fear the tyrant who either by public war or private treason will take away your life therefore my lord go travel for a while till that his rage and anger be forgot or till the destinies do cut his thread of life your rule direct to any if to me day serves not light more faithful than i 'll be i do not doubt thy faith but should he wrong my liberties in my absence we 'll mingle our bloods together in the earth from whence we had our being and our birth tyre i now look from thee then and to tarsus intend my travel where i 'll hear from thee and by whose letters i 'll dispose myself the care i had and have of subjects good on thee i lay whose wisdom 's strength can bear it i 'll take thy word for faith not ask thine oath who shuns not to break one will sure crack both but in our orbs we 'll

hush here come the lords of tyre enter helicanus and escanes with other lords of tyre you shall not need my fellow peers of tyre further to question me of your king 's departure his seal'd commission left in trust with me doth speak sufficiently he 's gone to travel aside   how the king gone if further yet you will be satisfied why as it were unlicensed of your loves he would depart i 'll give some light unto you being at antioch-- aside           what from antioch royal antiochus on what cause i know not-- took some displeasure at him at least he judged so and doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd to show his sorrow he'ld correct himself so puts himself unto the shipman 's toil with whom each minute threatens life or death aside   well i perceive i shall not be hang'd now although i would but since he 's gone the king 's seas must please he scaped the land to perish at the sea i 'll present myself peace to the lords of tyre lord thaliard from antiochus is welcome from him i come with message unto princely pericles but since my landing i have understood your lord has betook himself to unknown travels my message must return from whence it came we have no reason to

tables were stored full to glad the sight and not so much to feed on as delight all poverty was scorn'd and pride so great the name of help grew odious to repeat o tis too true but see what heaven can do by this our change these mouths who but of late earth sea and air were all too little to content and please although they gave their creatures in abundance as houses are defiled for want of use they are now starved for want of exercise those palates who not yet two summers younger must have inventions to delight the taste would now be glad of bread and beg for it those mothers who to nousle up their babes thought nought too curious are ready now to eat those little darlings whom they loved so sharp are hunger 's teeth that man and wife draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life here

out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste for comfort is too far for us to expect we have descried upon our neighbouring shore a portly sail of ships make hitherward i thought as much one sorrow never comes but brings an heir that may succeed as his inheritor and so in ours some neighbouring nation taking advantage of our misery hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power to beat us down the which are down already and make a conquest of unhappy me whereas no glory 's got to overcome that 's the least fear for by the semblance of their white flags display'd they bring us peace and come to us as favourers not as foes thou speak'st like him 's untutor'd to repeat who makes the fairest show means most deceit but bring they what they will and what they can what need we fear the

tumbled they say they 're half fish half flesh a plague on them they ne'er come but i look to be washed master i marvel how the fishes live in the sea why as men do a land the great ones eat up the

blest infusions that dwell in vegetives in metals stones and i can speak of the disturbances that nature works and of her cures which doth give me a more content in course of true delight than to be

pleased you had brought her hither to have bless'd mine eyes with her we can not but obey the powers above us could i rage and roar as doth the sea she lies in yet the end must be as tis my gentle babe marina whom for she was born at sea i have named so here i charge your charity withal leaving her the infant of your care beseeching you to give her princely training that she may be manner'd as she is born fear not my lord but think your grace that fed my country with your corn for which the people 's prayers still fall upon you must in your child be thought on if neglection should therein make me vile the common body by you relieved would force me to my duty but if to that my nature need a spur the gods revenge it upon me and mine to the end of generation i believe you your honour and

growing scene must find at tarsus and by cleon train'd in music letters who hath gain'd of education all the grace which makes her both the heart and place of general wonder but alack that monster envy oft the wrack of earned praise marina 's life seeks to take off by treason 's knife and in this kind hath our cleon one daughter and a wench full grown even ripe for marriage rite this maid hight philoten and it is said for certain in our story she would ever with marina be be't when she weaved the sleided silk with fingers long small white as milk or when she would with sharp needle wound the cambric which she made more sound by hurting it or when to the lute she sung and made the night bird mute that still records with moan or when she would with rich and constant pen vail to her mistress dian still this philoten contends in skill with absolute marina so with the dove of paphos might the crow vie feathers white marina gets all praises which are paid as debts and not as given this so darks in philoten all graceful marks that cleon 's wife with envy rare a present murderer does prepare for good marina that her daughter might stand peerless by this slaughter the sooner her vile thoughts to stead lychorida our nurse is dead and cursed dionyza hath the pregnant instrument of wrath prest for this blow the unborn event i do commend to your content only i carry winged time post

fearfully which you commit willingly despise profit where you have most gain to weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your lovers seldom but that pity begets you a good opinion and that opinion a

o dionyza such a piece of slaughter the sun and moon ne'er look'd upon i think you 'll turn a child again were i chief lord of all this spacious world i'ld give it to undo the deed o lady much less in blood than virtue yet a princess to equal any single crown o the earth i the justice of compare o villain leonine whom thou hast poison'd too if thou hadst drunk to him t had been a kindness becoming well thy fact what canst thou say when noble pericles shall demand his child that she is dead nurses are not the fates to foster it nor ever to preserve she died at night i 'll say so who can cross it unless you play the pious innocent and for an honest attribute cry out she died by foul play o go to well well of all the faults beneath the heavens the gods do like this worst be one of those that think the petty wrens of tarsus will fly hence and open this to pericles i do shame to think of what a noble strain you are and of how coward a spirit to such proceeding who ever but his approbation added though not his prime consent he did not flow from honourable sources be it so then yet none does know but you how she came dead nor none can know leonine being gone she did disdain my child and stood between her and her fortunes none would look on her but cast their gazes on marina 's face whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin not worth the time of day it pierced me through and though you call my course unnatural you not your child well loving yet i find it greets me as an enterprise of kindness perform'd to your sole daughter heavens forgive it and as for pericles what should he say we wept after her hearse and yet we mourn her monument is almost finish'd and her epitaphs in glittering golden characters express a general praise to her and care in us at whose expense tis done thou art like the harpy which to betray dost with thine angel 's face seize with thine eagle 's talons you are like one that superstitiously doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies but yet i know you 'll do as i advise exeunt scene iv enter gower before the monument of marina at tarsus thus time we waste and longest leagues make short sail seas in cockles have an wish but for't making to take your imagination from bourn to bourn region to region by you being pardon'd we commit no crime to use one language in each several clime where our scenes seem to live i do beseech you to learn of me who stand i the gaps to teach you the stages of our story pericles is now again thwarting the wayward seas attended on by many a lord and knight to see his daughter all his life 's delight old escanes whom helicanus late advanced in time to great and high estate is left to govern bear you it in mind old helicanus goes along behind well sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought this king to tarsus,--think his pilot thought so with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,-- to fetch his daughter home who first is gone like motes and shadows see them move awhile your ears unto your eyes i 'll reconcile dumb show enter pericles at one door with all his train   cleon and dionyza at the other cleon shows   pericles the tomb whereat pericles makes   lamentation puts on sackcloth and in a mighty passion departs then exeunt cleon and dionyza see how belief may suffer by foul show this borrow'd passion stands for true old woe and pericles in sorrow all devour'd with sighs shot through and biggest tears o'ershower'd leaves tarsus and again embarks he swears never to wash his face nor cut his hairs he puts on sackcloth and to sea he bears a tempest which his mortal vessel tears and yet he rides it out now please you wit the epitaph is for marina writ by wicked dionyza reads the inscription on marina 's monument the fairest sweet'st and best lies here who wither'd in her spring of year she was of tyrus the king 's daughter on whom foul death hath made this slaughter marina was she call'd and at her birth thetis being proud swallow'd some part o the earth therefore the earth fearing to be o'erflow'd hath thetis birth child on the heavens bestow'd wherefore she does and swears she 'll never stint make raging battery upon shores of flint no visor does become black villany so well as soft and tender flattery let pericles believe his daughter 's dead and bear his courses to be ordered by lady fortune while our scene must play his daughter 's woe and heavy well a day in her unholy service patience then and think you now are all in mytilene exit scene v. mytilene a street before the brothel enter from the brothel two gentlemen did you ever hear

do for clients her fitment and do me the kindness of our profession she has me her quirks her reasons her master reasons her prayers her knees that she would make a puritan of the devil if he should cheapen a kiss of her faith i must ravish her or she 'll disfurnish us of all our cavaliers and make our swearers priests now the pox upon her green sickness for me faith there 's no way to be rid on't but by the way to the pox here comes the lord lysimachus disguised we should have both lord and lown if the peevish baggage would but give way to customers enter lysimachus how now how a dozen of virginities now the gods to bless your honour i am glad to see your honour in good health you may so tis the better for you that your resorters stand upon sound legs how now wholesome iniquity have

what tis to say well enough well call forth call forth for flesh and blood sir white and red you shall see a rose and she were a rose indeed if she had but-- what prithee o sir i can be modest that dignifies the renown of a bawd no less than it gives a good report to a number to be chaste exit boult here comes that which grows to the stalk never plucked yet i can assure you re enter boult with marina is she not a fair creature faith she would serve after a long voyage at sea well there 's for you leave us i beseech your honour give me leave a word and i 'll have done presently i beseech you

equivalent with mighty kings but time hath rooted out my parentage and to the world and awkward casualties bound me in servitude aside i will desist but there is something glows upon my cheek and whispers in mine ear go not till he speak my fortunes parentage good parentage-- to equal mine!--was it not thus what say you i said my lord if you did know my parentage you would not do me violence i do think so pray you turn your eyes upon me you are like something that what country woman here of these shores no nor of any shores yet i was mortally brought forth and am no other than i appear i am great with woe and shall deliver weeping my dearest wife was like this maid and such a one my daughter might have been my queen 's square brows her stature to an inch as wand like straight as silver voiced her eyes as jewel like and cased as richly in pace another juno who starves the ears she feeds and makes them hungry the more she gives them speech where do you live where i am but a stranger from the deck you may discern the place where were you bred and how achieved you these endowments which you make more rich to owe if i should tell my history it would seem like lies disdain'd in the reporting prithee speak falseness can not come from thee for thou look'st modest as justice and thou seem'st a palace for the crown'd truth to dwell in i will believe thee and make my senses credit thy relation to points that seem impossible for thou look'st like one i loved indeed what were thy friends didst thou not say when i did push thee back-- which was when i perceived thee that thou camest from good descending so indeed i did report thy parentage i think thou said'st thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury and that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine if both were open'd some such thing i said and said no more but what my thoughts did warrant me was likely tell thy story if thine consider'd prove the thousandth part of my endurance thou art a man and i have

lightning flash advanced above pale envy 's threatening reach as when the golden sun salutes the morn and having gilt the ocean with his beams gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach and overlooks the highest peering hills so tamora upon her wit doth earthly honour wait and virtue stoops and trembles at her frown then aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts to mount aloft with thy imperial mistress and mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long hast prisoner held fetter'd in amorous chains and faster bound to aaron 's charming eyes than is prometheus tied to caucasus away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts i will be bright and shine in pearl and gold to wait upon this new made empress to wait said i to wanton with this queen this goddess this semiramis this nymph this siren that will charm rome 's saturnine and see his shipwreck and his commonweal 's holloa what storm is this enter demetrius and chiron braving chiron thy years want wit thy wit wants edge and manners to intrude where i am graced and may for aught thou know'st affected be demetrius thou dost over ween in all and so in this to bear me down with braves tis not the difference of a year or two makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate i am as able and as fit as thou to serve and to deserve my mistress grace and that my sword upon thee shall approve and plead my passions for lavinia 's love aside   clubs clubs these lovers will not keep the peace why boy although our mother unadvised gave you a dancing rapier by your side are you so desperate grown to threat your friends go to have your lath glued within your sheath till you know better how to handle it meanwhile sir with the little skill i have full well shalt thou perceive how much i dare ay boy grow ye so brave they draw coming forward   why how now lords so near the emperor 's palace dare you draw and maintain such a quarrel openly full well i wot the ground of all this grudge i would not for a million of gold the cause were known to them it most concerns nor would your noble mother for much more be so dishonour'd in the court of rome for shame put up not i till i have sheathed my rapier in his bosom and withal thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat that he hath breathed in my dishonour here for that i am prepared and full resolved foul spoken coward that thunder'st with thy tongue and with thy weapon nothing darest perform away i say now by the gods that warlike goths adore this petty brabble will undo us all why lords and think you not how dangerous it is to jet upon a prince 's right what is lavinia then become so loose or bassianus so degenerate that for her love such quarrels may be broach'd without controlment justice or revenge young lords beware and should the empress know this discord 's ground the music would not please i care not i knew she and all the world i love lavinia more than all the world youngling learn thou to make some meaner choice lavinia is thine elder brother 's hope why are ye mad or know ye not in rome how furious and impatient they be and can not brook competitors in love i tell you lords you do but plot your deaths by this device aaron a thousand deaths would i propose to achieve her whom i love to achieve her how why makest thou it so strange she is a woman therefore may be woo'd she is a woman therefore may be won she is lavinia therefore must be loved what man more water glideth by the mill than wots the miller of and easy it is of a cut loaf to steal a shive we know though bassianus be the emperor 's brother better than he have worn vulcan 's badge aside   ay and as good as saturninus may then why should he despair that knows to court it with words fair looks and liberality what hast not thou full often struck a doe and borne her cleanly by the keeper 's nose why then it seems some certain snatch or so would serve your turns ay so the turn were served aaron thou hast hit it would you had hit it too then should not we be tired with this ado why hark ye hark ye and are you such fools to square for this would it offend you then that both should speed faith not me nor me so i were one for shame be friends and join for that you jar tis policy and stratagem must do that you affect and so must you resolve that what you can not as you would achieve you must perforce accomplish as you may take this of me lucrece was not more chaste than this lavinia bassianus love a speedier course than lingering languishment must we pursue and i have found the path my lords a solemn hunting is in hand there will the lovely roman ladies troop the forest walks are wide and spacious and many unfrequented plots there are fitted by kind for rape and villany single you thither then this dainty doe and strike her home by force if not by words this way or not at all stand you in hope come come our empress with her sacred wit to villany and vengeance consecrate will we acquaint with all that we intend and she shall file our engines with advice that will not suffer you to square yourselves but to your wishes height advance you both the emperor 's court is like the house of fame the palace full of tongues of eyes and ears the woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull there speak and strike brave boys and take your turns there serve your lusts shadow'd from heaven 's eye and revel in lavinia 's treasury thy counsel lad smells of no cowardice sit fas aut nefas till i find the stream to cool this heat a charm to calm these fits per styga per manes vehor exeunt scene ii a forest near rome horns and cry of hounds heard enter titus andronicus with hunters   and c. marcus lucius quintus and martius the hunt is up the morn is bright and grey the fields are fragrant and the woods are green uncouple here and let us make a bay and wake the emperor and his lovely bride and rouse the prince and ring a hunter 's peal that all the court may echo with the noise sons let it be your charge as it is ours to attend the emperor 's person

lord will rouse the proudest panther in the chase and climb the highest promontory top and i have horse will follow where the game makes way and run like swallows o'er the plain chiron we hunt not we with horse nor hound but hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground exeunt scene iii a lonely part of the forest enter aaron with a bag of gold he that had wit would think that i had none to bury so much gold under a tree and never after to inherit it let him that thinks of me so abjectly know that this gold must coin a stratagem which cunningly effected will beget a very excellent piece of villany and so repose sweet gold for their unrest hides the gold that have their alms out of the empress chest enter tamora my lovely aaron wherefore look'st thou sad when every thing doth make a gleeful boast the birds chant melody on every bush the snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun the green leaves quiver with the cooling wind and make a chequer'd shadow on the ground under their sweet shade aaron let us sit and whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds replying shrilly to the well tuned horns as if a double hunt were heard at once let us sit down and mark their yelping noise and after conflict such as was supposed the wandering prince and dido once enjoy'd when with a happy storm they were surprised and curtain'd with a counsel keeping cave we may each wreathed in the other 's arms our pastimes done possess a golden slumber whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds be unto us as is a nurse 's song of lullaby to bring her babe asleep madam though venus govern your desires saturn is dominator over mine what signifies my deadly standing eye my silence and my cloudy melancholy my fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls even as an adder when she doth unroll to do some fatal execution no madam these are no venereal signs vengeance is in my heart death in my hand blood and revenge are hammering in my head hark tamora the empress of my soul which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee this is the day of doom for bassianus his philomel must lose her tongue to day thy sons make pillage of her chastity and wash their hands in bassianus blood seest thou this letter take it up i pray thee and give the king this fatal plotted scroll now question me no more we are espied here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty which dreads not yet their lives destruction ah my

our private steps had i the power that some say dian had thy temples should be planted presently with horns as was actaeon 's and the hounds should drive upon thy new transformed limbs unmannerly intruder as thou art under your patience gentle empress tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning and to be doubted that your moor and you are singled forth to try experiments jove shield your husband from his hounds to day tis pity they should take him for a stag believe me queen your swarth cimmerian doth make your honour of his body 's hue spotted detested and abominable why are you sequester'd from all your train dismounted from your snow white goodly steed and wander'd hither to an obscure plot accompanied but with a barbarous moor if foul desire had not conducted you and being intercepted in your sport great reason that my noble lord be rated for sauciness i pray you let us hence and let her joy her raven colour'd love this valley fits the purpose passing well the king my brother shall have note of this ay for these slips have made him noted long good king to be so mightily abused why have i patience to endure all this enter demetrius and chiron how now dear sovereign and our gracious mother why doth your highness look so pale and wan have i not reason think you to look pale these two have ticed me hither to this place a barren detested vale you see it is the trees though summer yet forlorn and lean o'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe here never shines the sun here nothing breeds unless the nightly owl or fatal raven and when they show'd me this abhorred pit they told me here at dead time of the night a thousand fiends a thousand hissing snakes ten thousand swelling toads as many urchins would make such fearful and confused cries as any mortal body hearing it should straight fall mad or else die suddenly no sooner had they told this hellish tale but straight they told me they would bind me here unto the body of a dismal yew and leave me to this miserable death and then they call'd me foul adulteress lascivious goth and all the bitterest terms that ever ear did hear to such effect and had you not by wondrous fortune come this vengeance on me had they executed revenge it as you love your mother 's life or be ye not henceforth call'd my children this is a witness that i am thy son stabs bassianus and this for me struck home to show my

thou bear'st a woman 's face,-- i will not hear her speak away with her sweet lords entreat her hear me but a word listen fair madam let it be your glory to see her tears but be your heart to them as unrelenting flint to drops of rain when did the tiger 's young ones teach the dam o do not learn her wrath she taught it thee the milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny yet every mother breeds not sons alike to chiron do thou entreat her show a woman pity what wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard tis true the raven doth not hatch a lark yet have i heard,--o could i find it now!-- the lion moved with pity did endure to have his princely paws pared all away some say that ravens foster forlorn children the whilst their own birds famish in their nests o be to me though thy hard heart say no nothing so kind but something pitiful i know not what it means away with her o let me teach thee for my father 's sake that gave thee life when well he might have slain thee be not obdurate open thy deaf ears hadst thou in person ne'er offended me even for his sake am i pitiless remember boys i pour'd forth tears in vain to save your brother from the sacrifice but fierce andronicus would not relent therefore away with her and use her as you will the worse to her the better loved of me o tamora be call'd a gentle queen and with thine own hands kill me in this place for tis not life that i have begg'd so long poor i was slain when bassianus died what begg'st thou then fond woman let me go tis present death i beg and one thing more that womanhood denies my tongue to tell o keep me from their worse than killing lust and tumble me into some loathsome pit where never man 's eye may behold my body do this and be a charitable murderer so should i rob my sweet sons of their fee no let them satisfy their lust on thee away for thou hast stay'd us here too long no grace no womanhood ah beastly creature the blot and enemy to our general

my spleenful sons this trull deflow'r exit re enter aaron with quintus and martius come on my lords the better foot before straight will i bring you to the loathsome pit where i espied the panther fast asleep my sight is very dull whate'er it bodes and mine i promise you were't not for shame well could i leave our sport to sleep awhile falls into the pit what art thou fall'n what subtle hole is this whose mouth is cover'd with rude growing briers upon whose leaves are drops of new shed blood as fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers a very fatal place it seems to me speak brother hast thou hurt thee with the fall o brother with the dismall'st object hurt that ever eye with sight made heart lament aside   now will i fetch the king to find them here that he thereby may give a likely guess how these were they that made away his brother exit why dost not comfort me and help me out from this unhallowed and blood stained hole i am surprised with an uncouth fear a chilling sweat o'er runs my trembling joints my heart suspects more than mine eye can see to prove thou hast a true divining heart aaron and thou look down into this den and see a fearful sight of blood and death aaron is gone and my compassionate heart will not permit mine eyes once to behold the thing whereat it trembles by surmise o tell me how it is for ne'er till now was i a child to fear i know not what lord bassianus lies embrewed here all on a heap like to a slaughter'd lamb in this detested dark blood drinking pit if it be dark how dost thou know tis he upon his bloody finger he doth wear a precious ring that lightens all the hole which like a taper in some monument doth shine upon the dead man 's earthy cheeks and shows the ragged entrails of the pit so pale did shine the moon on pyramus when he by night lay bathed in maiden blood o brother help me with thy fainting hand-- if fear hath made thee faint as me it hath-- out of this fell devouring receptacle as hateful as cocytus misty mouth reach me thy hand that i may help thee out or wanting strength to do thee so much good i may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb of this deep pit poor bassianus grave i have no strength to pluck thee to the brink nor i no strength to climb without thy help thy hand once more i will not loose again till thou art here aloft or i below thou canst not come to me i come to thee falls in enter saturninus with aaron along with me i 'll see what hole is here and what he is that now is leap'd into it say who art thou that lately didst descend into this gaping hollow of the earth the unhappy son of old andronicus brought hither in a most unlucky hour to find thy brother bassianus dead my brother dead i know thou dost but jest he and his lady both are at the lodge upon the north side of

to meet him handsomely-- sweet huntsman bassianus tis we mean-- do thou so much as dig the grave for him thou know'st our meaning look for thy reward among the nettles at the elder tree which overshades the mouth of that same pit where we decreed to bury bassianus do this and purchase us thy lasting friends o tamora was ever heard the like this is the pit and this the elder tree look sirs if you can find the huntsman out that should have murdered bassianus here my gracious lord here is the bag of gold to titus   two of thy whelps fell curs of bloody kind have here bereft my brother of his life sirs drag them from the pit unto the prison there let them bide until we have devised some never heard of torturing pain for them what are they in this pit o wondrous thing how easily murder is discovered high emperor upon my feeble knee i beg this boon with tears not lightly shed that this fell fault of my accursed sons accursed if the fault be proved in them,-- if it be proved you see it is apparent who found this letter tamora was it you andronicus himself did take it up i did my lord yet let me be their bail for by my father 's reverend tomb i vow they shall be ready at your highness will to answer their suspicion with their lives thou shalt not bail them see thou follow me some bring the murder'd body some the murderers let them not speak a word the guilt is plain for by my soul were there worse end than death that end upon them should be executed andronicus i will entreat the king fear not thy sons they shall do well enough come lucius come stay not to talk with them exeunt scene iv another part of the forest enter demetrius and chiron with lavinia ravished her hands cut off and her tongue cut out so now go tell an if thy tongue can speak who twas that cut thy tongue and ravish'd thee write down thy mind bewray thy meaning so an if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe see how with signs and tokens she can scrowl go home call for sweet water wash thy hands she hath no tongue to call nor hands to wash and so let 's leave her to her silent walks an twere my case i should go hang myself if thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord exeunt demetrius and chiron enter marcus who is this my niece that flies away so fast cousin a word where is your husband if i do dream would all my wealth would wake me if i do wake some planet strike me down that i may slumber in eternal sleep speak gentle niece what stern ungentle hands have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare of her two branches those sweet ornaments whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in and might not gain so great a happiness as have thy love why dost not speak to me alas a crimson river of warm blood like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips coming and going with thy honey breath but sure some tereus hath deflowered thee and lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue ah now thou turn'st away thy face for shame and notwithstanding all this loss of blood as from a conduit with three issuing spouts yet do thy cheeks look red as titan 's face blushing to be encountered with a cloud shall i speak for thee shall i say tis so o that i knew thy heart and knew the beast that i might rail at him to ease my mind sorrow concealed like an oven stopp'd doth burn the heart to cinders where it is fair philomela she but lost her tongue and in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind but lovely niece that mean is cut from thee a craftier tereus cousin hast thou met and he hath cut those pretty fingers off that could have better sew'd than philomel o had the monster seen those lily hands tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute and make the silken strings delight to kiss them he would not then have touch'd them for his life or had he heard the heavenly harmony which that sweet tongue hath made he would have dropp'd his knife and fell asleep as cerberus at the thracian poet 's feet come let us go and make thy father blind for such a sight will blind a father 's eye one hour 's storm will drown the fragrant meads what will whole months of tears thy father 's eyes do not draw back for we will mourn with thee o could our mourning ease thy misery exeunt act iii scene i. rome a street enter judges senators and tribunes with martius   and quintus bound passing on to the place of execution titus going before pleading hear me grave fathers noble tribunes stay for pity of mine age whose youth was spent in dangerous wars whilst you securely slept for all my blood in rome 's great quarrel shed for all the frosty nights that i have watch'd and for these bitter tears which now you see filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks be pitiful to my condemned sons whose souls are not corrupted as tis thought for two and twenty sons i never wept because they died in honour 's lofty bed lieth down the judges   and c. pass by him and exeunt for these these tribunes in the dust i write my heart 's deep languor and my soul 's sad tears let my tears stanch the earth 's dry appetite my sons sweet blood will make it shame and blush o earth i will befriend thee more with rain that shall distil from these two ancient urns than youthful april shall with all his showers in summer 's drought i 'll drop upon thee still in winter with warm tears i 'll melt the snow and keep eternal spring time on thy face so thou refuse to drink my dear sons blood enter lucius with his sword drawn o reverend tribunes o gentle aged men unbind my sons reverse the doom of death and let me say that never wept before my tears are now prevailing orators o noble father you lament in vain the tribunes hear you not no man is by and you recount your sorrows to a stone ah lucius for thy brothers let me plead grave tribunes once more i entreat of you,-- my gracious lord no tribune hears you speak why tis no matter man if they did hear they would not mark me or if they did mark they would not pity me yet plead i must therefore i tell my sorrows to the stones who though they can not answer my distress yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes for that they will not intercept my tale when i do weep they humbly at my feet receive my tears and seem to weep with me and were they but attired in grave weeds rome could afford no tribune like to these a stone is soft as wax,--tribunes more hard than stones a stone is silent and offendeth not and tribunes with their tongues doom men to death rises but wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn to rescue my two brothers from their death for which attempt the judges have pronounced my everlasting doom of banishment o happy man they have befriended thee why foolish lucius dost thou not perceive that rome is but a wilderness of tigers tigers must prey and rome affords no prey but me and mine how happy art thou then from these devourers to be banished but who comes with our brother marcus here enter marcus and lavinia titus prepare thy aged eyes to weep or if not so thy noble heart to break i bring consuming sorrow to thine age will it consume me let me see it then this was thy daughter why marcus so she is ay me this object kills me faint hearted boy arise and look upon her speak lavinia what accursed hand hath made thee handless in thy father 's sight what fool hath added water to the sea or brought a faggot to bright burning troy my grief was at the height before thou camest and now like nilus it disdaineth bounds give me a sword i 'll chop off my hands too for they have fought for rome and all in vain and they have nursed this woe in feeding life in bootless prayer have they been held up and they have served me to effectless use now all the service i require of them is that the one will help to cut the other tis well lavinia that thou hast no hands for hands to do rome service are but vain speak gentle sister who hath martyr'd thee o that delightful engine of her thoughts that blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage where like a sweet melodious bird it sung sweet varied notes enchanting every ear o say thou for her who hath done this deed o thus i found her straying in the park seeking to hide herself as doth the deer that hath received some unrecuring wound it was my deer and he that wounded her hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead for now i stand as one upon a rock environed with a wilderness of sea who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave expecting ever when some envious surge will in his brinish bowels swallow him this way to death my wretched sons are gone here stands my other son a banished man and here my brother weeping at my woes but that which gives my soul the greatest spurn is dear lavinia dearer than my soul had i but seen thy picture in this

disturbers of our peace buz in the people 's ears there nought hath pass'd but even with law against the willful sons of old andronicus and what an if his sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks his fits his frenzy and his bitterness and now he writes to heaven for his redress see here 's to jove and this to mercury this to apollo this to the god of war sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of rome what 's this but libelling against the senate and blazoning our injustice every where a goodly humour is it not my lords as who would say in rome no justice were but if i live his feigned ecstasies shall be no shelter to these outrages but he and his shall know that justice lives in saturninus health whom if she sleep he 'll so awake as she in fury shall cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives my gracious lord my lovely saturnine lord of my life commander of my thoughts calm thee and bear the faults of titus age the effects of sorrow for his valiant sons whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarr'd his heart and rather comfort his distressed plight than prosecute the meanest or the best for these contempts aside why thus it shall become

did is warlike lucius general of the goths these tidings nip me and i hang the head as flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms ay now begin our sorrows to approach tis he the common people love so much myself hath often over heard them say when i have walked like a private man that lucius banishment was wrongfully and they have wish'd that lucius were their emperor why should you fear is not your city strong ay but the citizens favor lucius and will revolt from me to succor him king be thy thoughts imperious like thy name is the sun dimm'd that gnats do fly in it the eagle suffers little birds to sing and is not careful what they mean thereby knowing that with the shadow of his wings he can at pleasure stint their melody even so mayst thou the giddy men of rome then cheer thy spirit for know thou emperor i will enchant the old andronicus with words more sweet and yet more dangerous than baits to fish or honey stalks to sheep when as the one is wounded with the bait the other rotted with delicious feed but he will not entreat his son for us if tamora entreat him then he will for i can smooth and fill his aged ear with golden promises that were his heart almost impregnable his old ears deaf yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue to aemilius go thou before be our ambassador say that the emperor requests a parley of warlike lucius and appoint the meeting even at his father 's house the old andronicus aemilius do this message honourably and if he stand on hostage for his safety bid him demand what pledge will please him best your bidding shall i do effectually exit now will i to that old andronicus and temper him with all the art i have to pluck proud lucius from the warlike goths and now sweet emperor be blithe again and bury all thy fear in my devices then go successantly and plead to him exeunt act v scene i. plains near rome enter lucius with an army of goths with drum and colours approved warriors and my faithful friends i have received letters from great rome which signify what hate they bear their emperor and how desirous of our sight they are therefore great lords be as your titles witness imperious and impatient of your wrongs and wherein rome hath done you any scath let him make treble satisfaction brave slip sprung from the great andronicus whose name was once our terror now our comfort whose high exploits and honourable deeds ingrateful rome requites with foul contempt be bold in us we 'll follow where thou lead'st like stinging bees in hottest summer 's day led by their master to the flowered fields and be avenged on cursed tamora and as he saith so say we all with him i humbly thank him and i thank you all but who comes here led by a lusty goth enter a goth leading aaron with his child in his arms renowned lucius from our troops i stray'd to gaze upon a ruinous monastery and as i earnestly did fix mine eye upon the wasted building suddenly i heard a child cry underneath a wall i made unto the noise when soon i heard the crying babe controll'd with this discourse peace tawny slave half me and half thy dam did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art had nature lent thee but thy mother 's look villain thou mightst have been an emperor but where the bull and cow are both milk white they never do beget a coal black calf peace villain peace!'--even thus he rates the babe,-- for i must bear thee to a trusty goth who when he knows thou art the empress babe will hold thee dearly for thy mother 's sake with this my weapon drawn i rush'd upon him surprised him suddenly and brought him hither to use as you think needful of the man o worthy goth this is the incarnate devil that robb'd andronicus of his good hand this is the pearl that pleased your empress eye and here 's the base fruit of his burning lust say wall eyed slave whither wouldst thou convey this growing image of thy fiend like face why dost not speak what deaf not a word a halter soldiers hang him on this tree and by his side his fruit of bastardy touch not the boy he is of royal blood too like the sire for ever being good first hang the child that he may see it sprawl a sight to vex the father 's soul withal get me a ladder a ladder brought which aaron is made to ascend lucius save the child and bear it from me to the empress if thou do this i 'll show thee wondrous things that highly may advantage thee to hear if thou wilt not befall what may befall i 'll speak no more but vengeance rot you all say on an if it please me which thou speak'st thy child shall live and i will see it nourish'd an if it please thee why assure thee lucius twill vex thy soul to hear what i shall speak for i must talk of murders rapes and massacres acts of black night abominable deeds complots of mischief treason villanies ruthful to hear yet piteously perform'd and this shall all be buried by my death unless thou swear to me my child shall live tell on thy mind i say thy child shall live swear that he shall and then i will begin who should i swear by thou believest no god that granted how canst thou believe an oath what if i do not as indeed i do not yet for i know thou art religious and hast a thing within thee called conscience with twenty popish tricks and ceremonies which i have seen thee careful to observe therefore i urge thy oath for that i know an idiot holds his bauble for a god and keeps the oath which by that god he swears to that i 'll urge him therefore thou shalt vow by that same god what god soe'er it be that thou adorest and hast in reverence to save my boy to nourish and bring him up or else i will discover nought to thee even by my god i swear to thee i will first know thou i begot him on the empress o most insatiate and luxurious woman tut lucius this was but a deed of charity to that which thou shalt hear of me anon twas her two sons that murder'd bassianus they cut thy sister 's tongue and ravish'd her and cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st o detestable villain call'st thou that trimming why she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd and twas trim sport for them that had the doing of it o barbarous beastly villains like thyself indeed i was their tutor to instruct them that codding spirit had they from their mother as sure a card as ever won the set that bloody mind i think they learn'd of me as true a dog as ever fought at head well let my deeds be witness of my worth i train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole where the dead corpse of bassianus lay i wrote the letter that thy father found and hid the gold within the letter mention'd confederate with the queen and her two sons and what not done that thou hast cause to rue wherein i had no stroke of mischief in it i play'd the cheater for thy father 's hand and when i had it drew myself apart and almost broke my heart with extreme laughter i pry'd me through the crevice of a wall when for his hand he had his two sons heads beheld his tears and laugh'd so heartily that both mine eyes were rainy like to his and when i told the empress of this sport she swooned almost at my pleasing tale and for my tidings gave me twenty kisses what canst thou say all this and never blush ay like a black dog as the saying is art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds ay that i had not done a thousand more even now i curse the day and yet i think few come within the compass of my curse,-- wherein i did not some notorious ill as kill a man or else devise his death ravish a maid or plot the way to do it accuse some innocent and forswear myself set deadly enmity between two friends make poor men 's cattle break their necks set fire on barns and hay stacks in the night and bid the owners quench them with their tears oft have i digg'd up dead men from their graves and set them upright at their dear friends doors even when their sorrows almost were forgot and on their skins as on the bark of trees have with my knife carved in roman letters let not your sorrow die though i am dead tut i have done a thousand dreadful things as willingly as one would kill a fly and nothing grieves me heartily indeed but that i can not do ten thousand more bring down the devil for he must not die so sweet a death as hanging presently if there be devils would i were a devil to live and burn in everlasting fire so i might have your company in hell but to torment you with my bitter tongue sirs stop his mouth and let him speak no more enter a goth my lord there is a messenger from rome desires to be admitted to your presence let him come near enter aemilius welcome aemilius \t what 's the news from rome lord lucius

ere i come to thee lo by thy side where rape and murder stands now give me some surance that thou art revenge stab them or tear them on thy chariot wheels and then i 'll come and be thy waggoner and whirl along with thee about the globe provide thee two proper palfreys black as jet to hale thy vengeful waggon swift away and find out murderers in their guilty caves and when thy car is loaden with their heads i will dismount and by the waggon wheel trot like a servile footman all day long even from hyperion 's rising in the east until his very downfall in the sea and day by day i 'll do this heavy task so thou destroy rapine and murder there these are my ministers and come with me are these thy ministers what are they call'd rapine and murder therefore called so cause they take vengeance

embracement will content thee i will embrace thee in it by and by exit above this closing with him fits his lunacy whate'er i forge to feed his brain sick fits do you uphold and maintain in your speeches for now he firmly takes me for revenge and being credulous in this mad thought i 'll make him send for lucius his son and whilst i at a banquet hold him sure i 'll find some cunning practise out of hand to scatter and disperse the giddy goths or at the least make them his enemies see here he comes and i must ply my theme enter titus below long have i been forlorn and all for thee welcome dread fury to my woful house rapine and murder you are welcome too how like the empress and her sons you are well are you fitted had you but a moor could not all hell afford you such a devil for well

revenged on them all look round about the wicked streets of rome and when thou find'st a man that 's like thyself good murder stab him he 's a murderer go thou with him and when it is thy hap to find another that is like to thee good rapine stab him he 's a ravisher go thou with them and in the emperor 's court there is a queen attended by a moor well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion for up and down she doth resemble thee i pray thee do on them some violent death they have been violent to me and mine well hast thou lesson'd us this shall we do but would it please thee good andronicus to send for lucius thy thrice valiant son who leads towards rome a band of warlike goths and bid him come and banquet at thy house when he is here even at thy solemn feast i will bring in the empress and her sons the emperor himself and all thy foes and at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel and on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart what says andronicus to this device marcus my brother tis sad titus calls enter marcus go gentle marcus to thy nephew lucius thou shalt inquire him out among the goths bid him repair to me and bring with him some of the chiefest princes of the goths bid him

not survive her shame and by her presence still renew his sorrows a reason mighty strong and effectual a pattern precedent and lively warrant for me most wretched to perform the like die die lavinia

you sad faced men people and sons of rome by uproar sever'd like a flight of fowl scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts o let me teach you how to knit again this scatter'd corn   into one mutual sheaf these broken limbs again into one body lest rome herself be bane unto herself and she whom mighty kingdoms court'sy to like a forlorn and desperate castaway do shameful execution on herself but if my frosty signs and chaps of age grave witnesses of true experience can not induce you to attend my words to lucius speak rome 's dear friend as erst our ancestor when with his solemn tongue he did discourse to love sick dido 's sad attending ear the story of that baleful burning night when subtle greeks surprised king priam 's troy tell us what sinon hath bewitch'd our ears or who hath brought the fatal engine in that gives our troy our rome the civil wound my heart is not compact of flint nor steel nor can i utter all our bitter grief but floods of tears will drown my oratory and break my utterance even in the time when it should move you to attend me most lending your kind commiseration here is a captain let him tell the tale your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak then noble auditory be it known to you that cursed chiron and demetrius were they that murdered our emperor 's brother and they it were that ravished our sister for their fell faults our brothers were beheaded our father 's tears despised and basely cozen'd of that true hand that fought rome 's quarrel out and sent her enemies unto the grave lastly myself unkindly banished the gates shut on me and turn'd weeping out to beg relief among rome 's enemies who drown'd their enmity in my true tears and oped their arms to embrace me as a friend i am the turned forth be it known to you that have preserved her welfare in my blood and from her bosom took the enemy 's point sheathing the steel in my adventurous body alas you know i am no vaunter i my scars can witness dumb although they are that my report is just and full of truth but soft methinks i do digress too much citing my worthless praise o pardon me for when no friends are by men praise themselves now is my turn to speak behold this child pointing to the child in the arms of an attendant of this was tamora delivered the issue of an irreligious moor chief architect and plotter of these woes the villain is alive in titus house and as he is to witness this is true now judge what cause had titus to revenge these wrongs unspeakable past patience or more than any living man could bear now you have heard the truth what say you romans have we done aught amiss,--show us wherein and from the place where you behold us now the poor remainder of andronici will hand in hand all headlong cast us down and on the ragged stones beat forth our brains and make a mutual closure of our house speak romans speak and if you say we shall lo hand in hand lucius and i will fall come come thou reverend man of rome and bring our emperor gently in thy hand lucius our emperor for well i know the common voice do cry it shall be so lucius all hail rome 's royal emperor go go into old titus sorrowful house to attendants and hither hale that misbelieving moor to be adjudged some direful slaughtering death as punishment for his most wicked life exeunt attendants lucius marcus and the others descend lucius all hail rome 's gracious governor thanks gentle romans may i govern so to heal rome 's harms and wipe away her woe but gentle people give me aim awhile for nature puts me to a heavy task stand all aloof but uncle draw you near to shed obsequious tears upon this trunk o take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips kissing titus these sorrowful drops upon thy blood stain'd face the last true duties of thy noble son tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss thy brother marcus tenders on thy lips o were the sum of these that i should pay countless and infinite yet would i pay them come hither boy come come and learn of us to melt in showers thy grandsire loved thee well many a time he danced thee on his knee sung thee asleep his loving breast thy pillow many a matter hath he told to thee meet and agreeing with thine infancy in that respect then like a loving child shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring because kind nature doth require it so friends should associate friends in grief and woe bid him farewell commit him to the grave do him that kindness and take leave of him o grandsire grandsire even with all my heart would i were dead so you did live again o lord i can not speak to him for weeping my tears will choke me if i ope my mouth re enter attendants with aaron you sad andronici have done with woes give sentence on this execrable wretch that hath been breeder of these dire events set him breast deep in earth and famish him there let him stand and rave and cry for food if any one relieves or pities him for the offence he dies this is our doom some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth o why should wrath be mute and fury dumb i am no baby i that with base prayers i should repent the evils i have done ten thousand worse than ever yet i did would i perform if i might have my will if one good deed in all my life i did i do repent it from my very soul some loving friends convey the emperor hence and give him burial in his father 's grave my father and lavinia shall forthwith be closed in our household 's monument as for that heinous tiger tamora no funeral rite nor man m mourning weeds no mournful bell shall ring her burial but throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey her life was beast like and devoid of pity and being so shall have like want of pity see justice done on aaron that damn'd moor by whom our heavy haps had their beginning then afterwards to order well the state that like events may ne'er it ruinate exeunt "}
